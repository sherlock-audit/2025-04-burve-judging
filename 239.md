# User can withdraw tokens without paying the intended tax due to an uninitialised variable in `removeValueSingle`â€™s fee calculation

### Summary

An uninitialised variable in `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle` makes the fee (`realTax`) evaluate to zero. Consequently, the protocol records no earnings while the user receives the full token amount, causing ongoing revenue loss and accounting mismatch.


### Root Cause

In the following code snippet: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214-L244
`removedBalance` is read before it is assigned. This causes the variable `removedBalance` to default to zero, which in turn causes `realTax` to be zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any user holding tokens in a closure withdrawing by calling `removeValueSingle()`.
2. The protocol is expecting a fee from withdrawals.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `removeValueSingle()` with valid parameters.
2. Function calculates `realTax = 0` due to the variable `removedBalance == 0`.
3. `c.addEarnings` records zero revenue.
4. User receives the full `realRemoved` tokens.
5. Repeating drains all fee income from this withdrawal path.

### Impact

Protocol fee collectors lose 100 % of revenue through this withdrawal path.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Compute the fee with the correct numerator (`realRemoved`): 
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;
```
