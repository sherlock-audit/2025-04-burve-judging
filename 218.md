# Zero-Adjustment Cache Ambiguity

### Summary

The `adjustments` mapping uses `0` to represent both uninitialized tokens and valid adjustments for 18-decimal tokens, causing redundant recomputation and gas waste.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/DecimalAdjustor.sol#L22`.  
- Design Flaw: The cache lacks a way to distinguish between:

   1. Tokens with no cached adjustment (`adjustments[token] = 0`).

   2. Tokens with 18 decimals (valid `adjustment = 0`).

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A token has exactly 18 decimals (e.g., WETH).

- `cacheAdjustment(token)` has been called (but the cache entry is `0`).

### External Pre-conditions

- The contract is used in a protocol where 18-decimal tokens are common.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `toNominal(token, value, roundUp)` for an 18-decimal token.

2. `getAdjustment(token)` reads `adjustments[token] = 0` and recomputes the adjustment (even if cached).

3. Gas is wasted on redundant computation.

### Impact

 Persistent gas inefficiency for 18-decimal tokens.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Use a separate `mapping(address => bool)` to track initialization.

2. Or, reserve `type(int256).min` as a sentinel value for uninitialized entries.
