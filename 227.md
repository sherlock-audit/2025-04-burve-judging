# Fees quietly left behind during `withdraw()`

### Summary

In [SimplexFacet.withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol#L248-L262), the contract snapshots its token balance before pulling in the latest protocol fees. As a result, the subsequent transfer only sends the old balance, leaving the newly minted “earned” fees stranded in the contract.

### Root Cause

Balance snapshot too early
```solidity
uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));  // 
```

Pull in fresh fees
```solidity
uint256 earned = SimplexLib.protocolGive(idx);            // 
```

Transfer only the stale snapshot

```solidity
if (balance > 0) {
    safeTransfer(token, owner, balance);                  // ③
}
```

Since balance was measured before `protocolGive()`, those “earned” tokens never get transferred

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The owner calls `withdraw(token)` when the contract holds protocol fees to claim.



### Attack Path

1. Protocol accrues fees on registered tokens.
2. Owner calls `withdraw(token)`.
3. `balance` is read (e.g. zero or stale).
4. `protocolGive()` mints/transfers the “earned” fees into the contract, but those aren’t added to balance.
5. Only the old balance is sent—fresh fees remain stuck indefinitely.

### Impact

Treasury accounting silently under-pays the owner. Unclaimed fees accumulate over time and can exceed 0.01% of protocol revenue, yet remain locked

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Move the balance snapshot after pulling fees, or explicitly transfer the earned amount.

```solidity
 function withdraw(address token) external {
     AdminLib.validateOwner();
 
-    uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
+    // Pull in all pending protocol fees first
     if (TokenRegLib.isRegistered(token)) {
         uint8 idx = TokenRegLib.getIdx(token);
         uint256 earned = SimplexLib.protocolGive(idx);
         emit FeesWithdrawn(token, /* oldBalance */ 0, earned);
     }
+
+    // Now snapshot and transfer whatever the contract holds
+    uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
     if (balance > 0) {
         TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, balance);
     }
 }
```

Or, after `protocolGive()`, explicitly `safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, earned)`; before—or instead of—using the snapshot
