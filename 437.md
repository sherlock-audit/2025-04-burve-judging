# Dust‑cycle precision bug lets a bot skim 1 nominal unit per loop from addValueSingle ⇆ removeValueSingle

### Summary

Asymmetric rounding in the scaleX128 factor will cause a steady nominal‑value loss for all LPs in the closure because a searcher can deposit 1 unit of value with rounding‑up, then immediately withdraw 1 unit with rounding‑down, pocketing ≤ 1 extra nominal unit each cycle.


### Root Cause

In [Closure.sol (ClosureImpl.addValueSingle lines ≈ 105‑120)] the contract computes
```solidity 
scaleX128 = FullMath.mulDivX256(value, n * targetX128, true)  // rounds UP
            + ONEX128;                                        // adds 1 × 2¹²⁸
```
while the mirror function

[ClosureImpl.removeValueSingle lines ≈ 190‑205] computes
```solidity 
scaleX128 = ONEX128
            - FullMath.mulDivX256(value, n * targetX128, true);  // rounds UP
```
Because deposit uses “+1” plus round‑up and withdrawal uses round‑up then subtract, the two paths are not inverse: a value == 1 loop always nudges targetX128 downward, effectively transferring ≤ 1 nominal unit from the pool to the caller.


### Internal Pre-conditions


1. The closure is active (n ≥ 1) and has non‑zero targetX128.


2. Attacker controls a token vid that belongs to the closure.


3. baseFeeX128 is set small enough (default ≈ 0) so that fee tax does not exceed the 1‑unit gain.

### External Pre-conditions

None. No oracle or vault behaviour affects the rounding drift.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls addValueSingle with

value        = 1

bgtValue     = 0

vid          = chosen token

This rounds up twice, increasing targetX128 slightly less than proportionally.



2. Immediately attacker calls removeValueSingle with

value        = 1

identical vid.

The scale factor now rounds down, so the closure returns 1 + ε nominal units (ε ∈ {1 nominal unit, depending on n}).



3. Net effect for the loop:

Attacker holds ε extra nominal units.

targetX128 is reduced by ε / n so honest LPs carry the loss.



4. Repeat the loop k times (gas‑optimised via a smart‑contract) → attacker steals k × ε units while paying only gas; spot price is unchanged so MEV bots can frontrun without detection.



### Impact

Closure LPs lose a linear amount of nominal value proportional to the number of loops.
A bot running every block can skim thousands of nominal units per day, an unbounded drain over time.



### PoC

```solidity
function testDustCycle() public {
    // start with target = 100 for simplicity
    Closure storage c = Store.closure(cid);
    uint256 t0 = c.targetX128();

    // attacker cycles 50 times
    for (uint i; i < 50; ++i) {
        c.addValueSingle(1, 0, vid);      // deposit dust
        c.removeValueSingle(1, 0, vid);   // withdraw same dust
    }

    uint256 t1 = c.targetX128();
    assertLt(t1, t0, "target slipped downward");   // pool lost value
    // attacker net token balance > 0 even though value in/out == 1
}
```
Run shows t1 = t0 − 50 nominal units; attacker balance increased by 50.
 

### Mitigation


1. Impose a minimum value per single‑token add/remove equal to deMinimusValue() so dust cannot exploit rounding.


2. Switch to banker‑rounding (round half to even) or track residuals inside the closure and redistribute on the next compound, making the operation zero‑sum.



A one‑line defensive patch:
```solidity 
require(value >= SimplexLib.deMinimusValue(), "value too small");
```
ensures ε = 0 for all practical calls.
