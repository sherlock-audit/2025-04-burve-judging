# Share Rounding Loss in `E4626` Leads to Incorrect Share Distribution and Emission of `InsufficientBalance` Event

### Summary

[E4626.sol#L102-L154](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L102-L154)
In the `E4626` vault, when users withdraw assets, the number of shares to be removed is calculated using the following formula:

```solidity
    /** Operations used by Vertex */

    function deposit(
        VaultE4626 storage self,
        VaultTemp memory temp,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        uint256 newlyAdding = FullMath.mulX128(
            temp.vars[1],
            temp.vars[3],
            true // Round up to round shares down.
        );
        uint256 totalAssets = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding - temp.vars[2];

        uint256 discountedAmount = FullMath.mulX128(
            amount,
            temp.vars[3],
            false // Round down to round shares down.
        );
        uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
            ? discountedAmount
            : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
        self.shares[cid] += newShares;
        self.totalShares += newShares;
        temp.vars[1] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw(
        VaultE4626 storage self,
        VaultTemp memory temp,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        uint256 newlyAdding = FullMath.mulX128(
            temp.vars[1],
            temp.vars[3],
            false // Round down to round shares removed up.
        );
        // We need to remove the assets we will remove because we're removing from total shares along the way.
        uint256 totalAssets = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding - temp.vars[2];
        // We don't check if we have enough assets for this cid to supply because
        // 1. The shares will underflow if we don't
        // 2. The outer check in vertex should suffice.
@     uint256 sharesToRemove = FullMath.mulDiv(
            self.totalShares,
            amount,
            totalAssets
        ); // Rounds down, leaves some share dust in the vault.
        self.shares[cid] -= sharesToRemove;
        self.totalShares -= sharesToRemove;
        temp.vars[2] += amount;
    }
```

This calculation rounds down, which can lead to some share dust remaining in the vault. While this behavior is acceptable for `Closure` vaults, where users can only withdraw a specific amount of value, it becomes problematic in the `Reserve` vault, where fees are collected.

In the `Reserve` vault, users can specify an exact amount of assets they want to withdraw by adding a small value and waiting for a swap to occur. When they do so, the `sharesToRemove` can round down to zero, causing the share value in the `Reserve` vault to inflate. This results in other `Closures` losing funds and potentially triggering the `InsufficientBalance` event.

Moreover, because `Reserve` has implemented its own vault logic, and similar rounding loss also happen when `E4626` trying to deposit assets but get no shares, for `Closure`, it's not a problem, but for a `Reserve`, the corresponding shares would still be minted, which is a problem.

### Root Cause

The issue arises due to the rounding behavior in the `E4626` vault. When a user attempts to withdraw a small amount of assets from the `Reserve` vault, the calculation of `sharesToRemove` in `E4626` may result in zero shares being removed, even though the actual assets are withdrawn.

This discrepancy occurs because the `E4626` vault's `totalShares` is less than the `totalAssets`, which can happen when the share value in the underlying ERC4626 is inflated. The `Reserve` vault, which is another vault, tracks the shares and can be affected by this rounding loss, leading to an imbalance in the distribution of funds among `Closures`.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. In `E4626`, `totalShares` is `1000` and `totalAssets` is `10000`, so it has `10000` assets. The `Reserve` holds `100` shares of `E4626`, and `1000` assets.
   | item | Shares | Assets |
   |------|--------|--------|
   | Total | 1000 | 10000 |
   | `Reserve` | 100 | 1000 |
   | Other `Closure` | 900 | 9000 |

2. In `Reserve`, the totalShares is `1000` and `Bob` holds all the shares. The totalAssets is `1000`.
3. In `Closure`, `Bob` holds `1000` value.



### External Pre-conditions

1. In the underlying `ERC4626`, the share value is `10` assets per share.


### Attack Path

1. `Bob` uses another address `Bob2` to deposit `90` value to `Closure`. Now, the `Closure` has `Bob`'s `1000` value and `Bob2`'s `90` value.
   | name | value |
   |--------|-------|
   | `Bob` | 1000 |
   | `Bob2` | 90 |

2. `109` assets of fees are added. In `Reserve`, the totalAssets is `1100` (with `9` assets rounded down), totalShares is `1109`, `Bob`'s share is `1100`, and `Bob2`'s share is `9`.
   | item | Shares | Assets |
   |--------|--------|--------|
   | Total | 1109 | 1100 |
   | `Bob` | 1100 | 1091 |
   | `Bob2` | 9 | 8 |

    In `E4626`, totalShares is `1010`, totalAssets is `10100`. `Reserve` holds `110` shares and `1100` assets.
    | item | Shares | Assets |
    |-----------------|--------|--------|
    | Total | 1010 | 10100 |
    | `Reserve` | 110 | 1100 |
    | Other `Closure` | 900 | 9000 |

3. `Bob2` withdraws the fees, burns one share in `Reserve`, and withdraws `9` assets from `E4626`. The `sharesToRemove` rounds down to `0`, but `Bob2` still receives the `9` assets.
4. As a result, in `E4626`, totalShares remains `1010`, totalAssets becomes `10090`. `Reserve` holds `110` shares and `1098` assets.
   | item | Shares | Assets |
   |------|--------|--------|
   | Total | 1010 | 10090 |
   | `Reserve` | 110 | 1098 |
   | Other `Closure` | 900 | 8992 |

5. `Bob` burns all shares in `Reserve` and gets `1098` assets. Other `Closures` lose `8` assets, which may lead to the emission of an `InsufficientBalance` event.


### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to exploit the rounding behavior in `E4626`, leading to incorrect distribution of funds among `Closures`. This also can happen by non-malicious users when they collect small fees. It can result in other `Closures` losing funds and potentially triggering the `InsufficientBalance` event, which is a significant security concern.

And also, this behavior can also lead to wrong fee distribution in `Reserve`.
