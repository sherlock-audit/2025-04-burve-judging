# Admin can silently modify Adjustors, reducing transparency and governance oversight.

### Summary

The` MixedAdjustor.sol: setAdjustor` and `MixedAdjustor.sol: setDefaultAdjustor` functions lack event emission, meaning `Adjustor ` assignments happen without on-chain visibility. This introduces a governance risk, making it harder to track modifications, detect unauthorized changes, and ensure accountability. Without event logging, stakeholders cannot monitor when Adjustors are modified, increasing the risk of unnoticed manipulation.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function setAdjustor(address token, address adjustor) external {
        AdminLib.validateOwner();
        adjAddr[token] = adjustor;
    }
function setDefaultAdjustor(address adjustor) external {
        AdminLib.validateOwner();
        defAdj = adjustor;
    }
```
The protocol enforces `ownership` checks before modifying `Adjustors ` via `AdminLib.validateOwner()`, ensuring only authorized users can set new `Adjustors`. However, these updates occur silently because no event is emitted, preventing real-time monitoring or retroactive analysis.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Caller must be the protocol `admin` to modify Adjustor mappings.
2. The function successfully updates `adjAddr[token]` or `defAdj,` affecting token normalization.

### External Pre-conditions

1. No on-chain events track Adjustor assignments.
2. External monitoring tools cannot detect changes unless they manually query contract state.
3.Users and governance participants are unaware when `Adjustors `are modified.

### Attack Path

1. An admin (or compromised admin key) sets a malicious or incorrect Adjustor.
2.  No event is emitted, making the change invisible to external monitoring tools.
3.  The malicious Adjustor modifies token adjustments without detection. 
4.  Users experience unintended financial impact, yet tracking the cause becomes difficult.

### Impact

1. Transparency Failure – Adjustor changes are invisible to stakeholders. 
2. Governance Risk – Untracked modifications reduce accountability in decentralized protocols. 
3. Potential Exploits – Silent Adjustor modifications may enable price manipulation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
event AdjustorSet(address indexed token, address indexed adjustor);
event DefaultAdjustorSet(address indexed adjustor);

function setAdjustor(address token, address adjustor) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();
    adjAddr[token] = adjustor;
    emit AdjustorSet(token, adjustor); 
}

function setDefaultAdjustor(address adjustor) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();
    defAdj = adjustor;
    emit DefaultAdjustorSet(adjustor); 
}
```
