# Insufficient iterations and strict convergence criteria in Newton's method can lead to transaction failures

## Description:
The `SearchParamsImpl` library in `Value.sol` uses Newton's method to find equilibrium target values for token balances in a closure. The current implementation has very restrictive parameters that may cause the algorithm to fail to converge in extreme market conditions, leading to transaction failures and potential denial of service.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Value.sol#L22
```solidity
    function init(SearchParams storage self) internal {
        self.maxIter = 5;
        self.deMinimusX128 = 100;
        self.targetSlippageX128 = 1e12;
    }
```
The `SearchParams` initialization sets:

`maxIter = 5` (only 5 iterations allowed)
`deMinimusX128 = 100` (extremely small convergence threshold)
`targetSlippageX128 = 1e12` (still very small acceptable deviation)

These restrictive parameters create a vulnerability where legitimate transactions may fail when token balances are highly imbalanced or when price movements are significant, as the algorithm cannot converge within the allowed iterations and precision requirements.

Despite the presence of the `setSearchParams()` function in the `SimplexFacet` contract, the initial values are set in the `Value::init()` function and are extremely restrictive. Additionally, the `setSearchParams()` function only checks that `deMinimusX128` is positive, but does not validate the other parameters. There is no minimum value check for `maxIter`, and no validations for `targetSlippageX128`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol#L359
```solidity
    function setSearchParams(SearchParams calldata params) external {
        AdminLib.validateOwner();

        if (params.deMinimusX128 <= 0) {
            revert NonPositiveDeMinimusX128(params.deMinimusX128);
        }

        SimplexLib.setSearchParams(params);

        emit SearchParamsChanged(
            msg.sender,
            params.maxIter,
            params.deMinimusX128,
            params.targetSlippageX128
        );
    }
```

## Attack path:
1. Market conditions cause significant imbalance in a closure's token reserves
2. A user attempts to perform a swap through this closure
3. The `t()` function in `ValueLib` is called to find the equilibrium target value
4. Due to the imbalance, Newton's method cannot converge within 5 iterations to the required precision
5. The transaction reverts with `TSolutionNotFound` error
6. The closure becomes temporarily unusable for swaps until market conditions change or balances are rebalanced

This is particularly problematic during high volatility periods when the protocol should be most reliable.

## Impact:
Temporary denial of service for specific closures during market stress

## Recommended Mitigation:
Increase the maximum number of iterations
```solidity
self.maxIter = 15; // Up from 5
```
Relax the convergence criteria
```solidity
self.deMinimusX128 = 10000; // Up from 100
self.targetSlippageX128 = 1e15; // Up from 1e12
```

Consider implementing checks in `SimplexFacet::setSearchParams()` for `maxIter` and `targetSlippageX128`.
