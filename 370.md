# Lack of storage gap makes future updates impossible/hard

### Summary
The project uses nested structures to store data, which may complicate or make future upgrades impossible. In extreme cases, upgrades could lead to data inconsistency and improper system operation.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Store.sol#L16-L26
```solidity
struct Storage {
    AssetBook assets;
    TokenRegistry tokenReg;
    VaultStorage _vaults;
    Simplex simplex;
    Locker _locker;
    Reserve _reserve;
    // Graph elements
    mapping(ClosureId => Closure) closures;
    mapping(VertexId => Vertex) vertices;
}
```
Because the struct packs concrete sub-structs back-to-back with no reserved gap, If a facet is updated with a new storage variable, the other parts of storage will get overwritten.
This is a problem analogous to storage gaps in upgradable contracts, but in a more advanced and complicated form, which is why it should be rated as medium.

### Impact
Using nested structures for data storage complicates future upgrades. In extreme cases, this can lead to data inconsistency and improper system operation, which is particularly dangerous in financial systems.

### PoC
In a later upgrade, developers want to add a new variable into `Simplex` struct:
```solidity
// Stores information unchanged between all closures.
struct Simplex {
    string name;
    string symbol;
    address adjustor;
    address bgtEx;
    /// New closures are made with at least this much target value.
    uint256 initTarget;
    /// The efficiency factor for each token.
    uint256[MAX_TOKENS] esX128;
    /// A scaling factor for calculating the min acceptable x balance based on e.
    uint256[MAX_TOKENS] minXPerTX128;
    /// Amounts earned by the protocol for withdrawal.
    uint256[MAX_TOKENS] protocolEarnings;
    /// Parameters used by ValueLib.t to search
    SearchParams searchParams;
    /// @audit-info new variable added here
    uint256 X;
}
```
after this upgrade, every slot after the insertion point shifts and overwritten storage slots might result in disastrous consequences.
