# Struct in struct data type will disrupt upgrades

### Summary

The choice of using nested struct data structure will disrupt future upgrades as introducing new variables may interfare with previously stored data

### Root Cause

```solidity
struct Storage {
@>> AssetBook assets;
@>> TokenRegistry tokenReg;
    VaultStorage _vaults;
    Simplex simplex;
    Locker _locker;
    Reserve _reserve;
    // Graph elements
    mapping(ClosureId => Closure) closures;
    mapping(VertexId => Vertex) vertices;
}
```

The above struct can be found in [strore.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Store.sol#L16). It holds valuble data within the protocol. There are structs within it, which will make upgrade difficult 

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

Upgrade attempt introducing new state variables

### Attack Path

protocol attempts upgrade

### Impact

Data overwrite leading to corruption of relevant data

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use the mapping data types in the struct instead.
