# Inactive LP Positions Dilute Active LP Fee Earnings

### Summary

Because Uniswap v3 distributes swap fees to all LP token holders based on share count—without verifying that their positions were active during the swap—active liquidity providers will see their fee earnings reduced, as inactive LPs still collect a portion of the fees.



### Root Cause

In the Uniswap v3 fee‐distribution logic, fees collected from swaps update a global fee growth variable and are later claimable by any LP proportional to their total shares—regardless of whether their tick range was active at the swap price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

n LP calls mint(...) with a very tight [lower, upper] tick range.

Market price moves outside this range, marking the LP’s position inactive.

No on-chain check excludes inactive positions when updating or claiming fee growth.



### External Pre-conditions

Traders execute swaps at prices outside the inactive LP’s tick range.

The pool’s global fee accumulator increases based on swap volume, covering in- and out-of-range swaps alike.

### Attack Path

LP deposits liquidity with narrow ticks around a target price.

Price shift occurs, deactivating their position.

A swap at the new price collects fees.

Uniswap v3 increments its global fee growth.

When LP later claims fees, they receive a share of all accumulated fees—even those from swaps in which their position was inactive.



### Impact

Active Liquidity Providers suffer lower effective yields as inactive LPs siphon off a portion of swap fees, diluting rewards for those whose capital was actually at risk.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Restrict Fee Accrual to Active Ranges: Modify fee‐distribution to allocate only to positions whose [lower, upper] ticks contain the swap price.
