# vertex-lock bypass via `ValueFacet::removeValue` function

### Summary
`Vertex.lock()` flips a per-token flag that should prevent any outgoing transfer from that vertex. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L146-L148

Withdrawal helpers (`Vertex.withdraw`) respect the flag only when the caller passes `checkLock = true`:
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        Vertex storage self,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount,
        bool checkLock
    ) internal {
        //@audit respect the flag only if checkLock is true
        require(!(checkLock && self._isLocked), VertexLocked(self.vid));
        VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
        vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
        vProxy.commit();
    }
```
Functions such as `removeValueSingle`, `removeTokenForValue`, and `unstakeValue` already defend against locked vertices with
```solidity
        require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
```
But `Closure.removeValue` (multi-token withdrawal), does not call `isAnyLocked`, and pass false for `checkLock` when it invokes `Vertex.withdraw`, Consequently funds can be pulled from a locked vault:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L207
```solidity
            Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realSend, false);
```

### Root Cause
`checkLock` flag mis-used â€“ `Closure.removeValue` sets the `checkLock` flag to false and also does not check whether any vertex is locked or not (using `isAnyLocked`).
All other functions across the code either:
- set `checkLock` to `false` but use `isAnyLocked` function
- set `checkLock` to true so that lock check will be performed in the vertex itself
but `vaultFacet::removeValue` and `closure::removeValue` completely bypass this checks.

### Internal Pre-conditions
- Vertex X has `_isLocked = true`
- One or more closures hold positive balances of vertex `X`
- User calls `ValueFacet::removeValue` and withdraws from the `X` vertex

### Impact
Protocol advertised a safety control which does not actually work in all paths.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
set the `checkLock` flag to true in the `ValueFacet::removeValue`:
```diff
-            Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realSend, false);
+            Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realSend, true);
```
