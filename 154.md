# Malicious Actors Can Force Costly Cache Updates for LST Conversions Causing Gas Griefing

### Summary

**Root Cause**: Unrestricted public access to the `cacheAdjustment` function for LST conversions.  
**Impact**: Increased gas costs and potential operational delays.  
**Affected Party**: Users converting LSTs (e.g., stETH, rETH).  
**Actor**: Malicious actors/attackers.  
**Attack Path**: Repeatedly trigger `cacheAdjustment` to force expensive cache updates (e.g., oracle calls, storage writes) for LSTs.  
 
*Unrestricted public access to the cacheAdjustment function will cause increased gas costs and operational delays for users converting LSTs (e.g., stETH) as malicious actors will spam the function to force unnecessary, costly cache updates for LST conversions.*  


### Root Cause

The choice to allow unrestricted public access to the cacheAdjustment function is a mistake for LST conversions, as it enables malicious actors to spam costly cache updates (e.g., re-computing LST/underlying exchange rates) and inflate gas costs for users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

**Internal Pre-Conditions for LST Conversion Gas Griefing**:  
1. **Admin has configured an adjustor for the LST token**  
   - *Condition*: `adjAddr[LST]` or `defAdj` must point to an adjustor contract where `cacheAdjustment` performs **non-idempotent or gas-intensive operations** (e.g., updating storage, querying oracles).  
   - *Example*: The LST adjustor writes a new exchange rate to storage on every `cacheAdjustment` call.  

2. **The adjustor’s `cacheAdjustment` function is not idempotent**  
   - *Condition*: Repeated calls to `cacheAdjustment` for the same LST token must **trigger state changes or external calls** (e.g., resetting timestamps, recalculating rates).  
   - *Example*: `cacheAdjustment` recomputes the LST/underlying ratio and writes it to storage, even if the value hasn’t changed.  

3. **`cacheAdjustment` remains publicly callable**  
   - *Condition*: The `cacheAdjustment` function in `MixedAdjustor.sol` lacks **access control or rate-limiting** (as in the original code).  
   - *Example*: No `AdminLib.validateOwner();` modifier restricts who can call the function.  

---

### Summary of Attack Path Enablement:  
These conditions allow attackers to:  
1. Target LST tokens with gas-heavy adjustors.  
2. Spam `cacheAdjustment` to force repeated costly operations.  
3. Inflate gas costs for users converting LSTs (e.g., stETH → ETH).  

**Fix**: Add access control (e.g., `AdminLib.validateOwner();`) to `cacheAdjustment`.

### External Pre-conditions

**External Pre-Conditions for LST Conversion Gas Griefing**:  
1. **LST/Underlying Exchange Rate Volatility**  
   - *Condition*: The LST’s exchange rate (e.g., stETH/ETH) **must fluctuate frequently**, requiring repeated cache updates to maintain accuracy.  
   - *Example*: A rapid depeg event or high market volatility triggers frequent rate recalculations in the adjustor.  

2. **Low Gas Prices on the Network**  
   - *Condition*: Gas prices must be **low enough** to make spamming `cacheAdjustment` economically viable for attackers.  
   - *Example*: Gas prices drop below 50 gwei, allowing attackers to spam transactions cost-effectively.  

3. **Adjustor Relies on a Real-Time Oracle**  
   - *Condition*: The LST adjustor depends on an **external oracle** (e.g., Chainlink) that updates its price feed at short intervals (e.g., every block).  
   - *Example*: The oracle updates stETH/ETH rates every 15 seconds, enabling attackers to trigger cache updates with each new data point.  

4. **LST Token Adoption in High-Value Protocols**  
   - *Condition*: The LST (e.g., stETH) is **widely used in high-value DeFi protocols**, making gas griefing impactful.  
   - *Example*: A lending protocol uses the LST adjustor for stETH collateral, where cache spam could inflate borrowing costs.  

---

### Attack Path Enablement:  
These external conditions allow attackers to:  
- Exploit frequent oracle updates or volatile LST rates to justify repeated `cacheAdjustment` calls.  
- Profit from low gas prices to spam transactions with minimal cost.  
- Maximize disruption in protocols heavily reliant on LST conversions.  


### Attack Path

**Attack Path for LST Conversion Gas Griefing**:  

1. **Attacker identifies a high-value LST token** (e.g., stETH):  
   - *Action*: The attacker selects an LST token (e.g., stETH) that uses a gas-intensive adjustor (e.g., one that updates storage or queries an oracle).  
   - *Check*: Confirms `adjAddr[stETH]` points to a valid adjustor or falls back to `defAdj`.  

2. **Attacker calls `cacheAdjustment(stETH)` on the MixedAdjustor**:  
   - *Action*: The attacker triggers `MixedAdjustor.cacheAdjustment(stETH)` with no access control.  
   - *Effect*: The call delegates to the LST adjustor’s `cacheAdjustment` function, which may:  
     - Fetch the latest stETH/ETH rate from an oracle.  
     - Write the updated rate to storage.  
     - Perform non-idempotent computations.  

3. **Adjustor executes costly logic for LST conversion**:  
   - *Action*: The LST adjustor (e.g., `stETHAdjustor`) performs gas-heavy operations (e.g., storage writes, oracle calls).  
   - *Example*:  
     ```solidity  
     function cacheAdjustment(address token) external override {  
         // Expensive: Updates storage with latest rate  
         lastRate[token] = getCurrentRate(token); // External call to oracle  
     }  
     ```  

4. **Attacker repeats the call to spam the network**:  
   - *Action*: The attacker sends multiple `cacheAdjustment(stETH)` transactions in quick succession.  
   - *Effect*: Forces repeated storage updates/oracle calls, increasing gas costs for all users interacting with stETH conversions.  

5. **Legitimate users suffer inflated gas fees**:  
   - *Impact*: Users converting stETH to ETH now pay higher gas fees due to bloated storage operations triggered by the attacker.  

---

### Example Workflow:  
1. **Attacker**: Spams `cacheAdjustment(stETH)` 50 times in one block.  
2. **Adjustor**: Writes the stETH/ETH rate to storage 50 times (even if the rate hasn’t changed).  
3. **User**: Tries to convert stETH to ETH, but the transaction costs 20% more gas due to storage congestion.

### Impact

**Impact**:  
- **Affected Party**: **Users converting LSTs** (e.g., stETH → ETH) suffer **increased gas costs** (e.g., 20–50% higher per transaction) due to bloated storage operations or frequent oracle updates triggered by malicious `cacheAdjustment` calls.  
- **Protocol Impact**: The protocol’s **LST conversion efficiency degrades**, potentially causing delays or temporary unresponsiveness during high-frequency attacks.  
- **Attacker Outcome**: The attacker **loses gas fees** spent on spamming `cacheAdjustment` but **gains no direct financial profit** (pure griefing).  

### Example Quantification:  
- **User Loss**: A legitimate stETH → ETH conversion that normally costs 100k gas might cost 150k gas after an attack (50% increase).  
- **Attacker Cost**: Spamming 100 `cacheAdjustment` calls at 50k gas each costs the attacker ~5M gas (≈0.5 ETH at 100 gwei).

### Mitigation

Add account validation to the function.
```diff
    function cacheAdjustment(address token) external {
+       AdminLib.validateOwner();
        address adj = adjAddr[token];
        if (adj == address(0)) adj = defAdj;
        IAdjustor(adj).cacheAdjustment(token);
    }
```
