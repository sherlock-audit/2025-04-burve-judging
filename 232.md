# Initial Mint Enforcement Weakness

### Summary

The `mint()` function lacks a lock to prevent multiple "first mints" to `address(this)` after the initial dead shares are minted, allowing potential dilution of dead shares.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L267` The contract enforces the first mint (`totalShares == 0`) to send `MIN_DEAD_SHARES` to `address(this)`, but fails to block subsequent mints to `address(this)`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `totalShares == 0` (first mint).

- Caller must provide `shares >= MIN_DEAD_SHARES` and `recipient = address(this)`.

### External Pre-conditions

- Attacker must call `mint()` after the legitimate first mint.



### Attack Path

1. Legitimate user mints `MIN_DEAD_SHARES` to `address(this)`.

2. Attacker calls `mint(address(this), MIN_DEAD_SHARES, ...)` repeatedly.

3. Dead shares are artificially inflated, diluting share accounting.

### Impact

 No fund loss, but disrupts share distribution logic.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Track whether the initial mint has occurred using a state variable

2. Prevent any subsequent mints to `address(this)`
For Example: 
```solidity
bool public initialMintCompleted; // State variable to track initial mint

function mint(...) external {
    if (totalShares == 0) {
        // First mint requirements
        require(shares >= MIN_DEAD_SHARES, "Insufficient dead shares");
        require(recipient == address(this), "First mint must be to contract");
        initialMintCompleted = true; // Mark initial mint as complete
    }
    // Prevent any future mints to address(this)
    require(recipient != address(this) || !initialMintCompleted, "Dead shares already minted");
    ...
}

```
