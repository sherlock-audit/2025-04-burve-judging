### Summary

The [isAnyLocked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L879) function in the Burve protocol's ClosureImpl contract iterates through all tokens (vertices) within a closure to check if any are locked. If even a single token is locked, the function returns true, preventing all withdrawal operations for the entire closure using [removeValueSingle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L252) and [removeTokenForValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L343). This design means that users cannot withdraw from unlocked tokens if any other token in the closure is locked.

### Root Cause

In the Closure contract, the isAnyLocked function is implemented as follows:
```solidity
function isAnyLocked(Closure storage self) internal returns (bool isLocked) {
    for (
        VertexId vIter = VertexLib.minId();
        !vIter.isStop();
        vIter = vIter.inc()
    ) {
        if (self.cid.contains(vIter)) {
            if (Store.vertex(vIter).isLocked()) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
This function checks each vertex in the closure, and if any are locked, it returns true, blocking single withdrawal operations for the entire closure.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A closure contains multiple tokens (vertices), for example, tokens 1 through 16.
2. At least one token within the closure is locked.
3. A user attempts to withdraw from an unlocked token within the same closure.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a withdrawal from an unlocked token within a closure.
2. The withdrawal process calls the isAnyLocked function to check the lock status of the closure.
3. Since another token in the closure is locked, isAnyLocked returns true.
4. The withdrawal operation is blocked, and the user cannot access their funds from the unlocked token.

### Impact

Users are unable to withdraw their assets from unlocked tokens within a closure if any other token in the same closure is locked. This can lead to unnecessary restrictions on user funds and may affect user trust and protocol usability.


### Mitigation

Modify the withdrawal logic to check the lock status of the specific token involved in the withdrawal rather than using the isAnyLocked function.
