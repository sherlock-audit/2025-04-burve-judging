# Unrestricted Adjustor Assignment Leads to Full Protocol Compromise

### Summary

Unrestricted assignment of the adjustor address will cause a full protocol compromise for protocol users and protocol funds as any attacker can overwrite governance-critical parameters and control protocol behavior.

### Root Cause

In [SimplexLib.sol:173](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Simplex.sol#L173), there is no access control on the setAdjustor function, allowing any address to become the protocol's adjustor.
```solidity
function setAdjustor(address a) internal {
    load().adjustor = a;
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any external user must be able to call a contract function that triggers `SimplexLib.setAdjustor()`, directly or indirectly.

### External Pre-conditions

- None. No oracle or off-chain conditions needed.



### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls the function that internally triggers `SimplexLib.setAdjustor(attackerAddress)`.
2. Attacker becomes the protocol's adjustor.
3. Attacker uses their new privileges to:
   - Set malicious efficiency parameters (setEX128, setIN128).
   - Drain or redirect protocol earnings (protocolGive).
   - Brick vaults or manipulate target calculations (setTargetInit).

### Impact

- The protocol and users suffer a total loss of control and funds.
- The attacker gains complete protocol control.
- Estimated impact: up to 100% of user and protocol assets compromised.

### PoC

```solidity
// Attacker becomes adjustor
SimplexLib.setAdjustor(attackerAddress);

// Attacker sets efficiency to 0
SimplexLib.setEX128(0, 0);

// Attacker drains protocol earnings
SimplexLib.protocolGive(0);

// Attacker sets malicious search parameters
SimplexLib.setTargetInit(0, 0);
```

### Mitigation

Restrict setAdjustor() to be callable only by the owner, governor, or multisig using an onlyOwner or equivalent modifier.

Example:
```solidity
function setAdjustor(address a) external onlyOwner {
    load().adjustor = a;
}
```
