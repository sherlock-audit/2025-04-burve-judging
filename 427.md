# Complex shared storage layout will block upgrades and use outdated definitions

### Summary  
The use of deeply nested structs in a shared `Storage` layout will block future upgrades to individual facets, and local struct changes (like in `LockFacet`) will be ignored because `Store` keeps using the old version compiled earlier.

### Root Cause  
The design choice to use a large shared `Storage` struct that includes nested structs from each facet is a mistake because:

1. **Nested structs can’t be expanded later** — Solidity requires storage layout to stay exactly the same, so adding variables inside these structs will break things.
2. **Some structs (like [LockFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/LockFacet.sol#L14-L14)) are defined inside the facet file** and then imported into `Store`. Even if the facet is updated with a new version of the struct, `Store` keeps using the old one that was imported during the previous deployment. This means the facet looks like it's using the new struct, but it's actually working with the old one.

This makes upgrades unsafe and confusing, similar to what happens if you forget to add storage gaps in UUPS proxies — which Sherlock considers a medium issue in complex designs like this.

### Internal pre-conditions  
1. The `Store` struct includes nested structs for many facets (like `Locker`, `Reserve`, `Simplex`, etc.)  
2. These structs are imported from other files and locked in at compile time  

### External pre-conditions  
1. A developer tries to upgrade a facet (e.g. `LockFacet`) and changes the struct definition (e.g. adds new fields to `Locker`)  
2. The new facet is deployed expecting the new struct layout to be used  

### Attack Path  
1. A developer updates `LockFacet`, adding a new variable inside the `Locker` struct  
2. Even though the facet is upgraded, the `Store` library still uses the old `Locker` struct  
3. The facet’s functions appear to use the new struct, but actually operate on the old layout in storage  
4. This causes bugs, like writing to the wrong slot or not being able to access new variables  
5. Future upgrades become risky or impossible due to storage mismatches  

### Impact  
The protocol cannot safely upgrade facets like `LockFacet`, because:

- Nested structs can’t be changed without breaking storage layout  
- Structs defined in facet files (like `Locker`) are stuck at the version imported during the original deployment

This can cause bugs, state corruption, or broken lock control. It also blocks the protocol from evolving safely. Sherlock rules say that issues like this are **medium severity** when the architecture is complex — and in this case, it definitely is.

### PoC
No PoC needed — this is a structural design problem.

### Mitigation
- Don’t use a single shared `Storage` struct for everything. Instead, give each facet its own `StorageLib` and storage slot.
