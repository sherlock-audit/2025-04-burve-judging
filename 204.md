# Missing Locked‐Vertex Guard in removeValue

### Title
Missing Locked‐Vertex Guard in `Closure.sol::removeValue`

### Severity
Impact: Medium–High
	•	Locked vertices may represent assets that cannot be redeemed from external vaults. Allowing removeValue to bypass the lock can lead to underflows, stale accounting, or unauthorized withdrawals of illiquid assets.
Likelihood: Medium
	•	Any closure with one or more locked vertices but non-zero valueStaked will be vulnerable until a fix is deployed.

### Difficulty


### Type


### Target
src/multi/closure/Closure.sol

## Description
Unlike the single‐token removal paths `removeValueSingle` and `removeTokenForValue` and the staking withdrawal `unstakeValue`, the multi‐token removal function `removeValue` does not check whether any of the closure’s vertices are locked `isAnyLocked(self)`. As a result, even when all underlying pools are in a locked state (e.g. during emergency or maintenance), a user can still call `removeValue(...)` and withdraw value across all tokens.

## Exploit Scenario
1.	Operator locks all underlying vertices (e.g. during protocol maintenance).
2.	User calls:
```solidity
ValueFacet.removeValue(user, cid, value, bgtValue);
```
3.	Because there is no require`!isAnyLocked(self)` at the top of `removeValue`, the function proceeds to trim balances and reduce `self.balances[i]` for every token—potentially calling external vault withdrawals on locked vaults or underflowing local balances.
4.	The user is able to withdraw tokens that should have been withheld until the lock is lifted, circumventing the emergency pause.

## Recommendations
Add the same locked‐state guard used in the single‐token and staking withdrawal methods to the top of removeValue:
```solidity
 function removeValue(
     Closure storage self,
     uint256 value,
     uint256 bgtValue
 ) internal returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory withdrawnBalances) {
+    require(
+        !isAnyLocked(self),
+        CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid)
+    );
     trimAllBalances(self);
     // … rest of removal logic …
 }
```
