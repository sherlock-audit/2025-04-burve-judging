# User withdrawals revert and backup exchange BGT is locked if primary exchange is underfunded

### Summary

In `BGTExchanger.sol`, the function `getOwed()` sums both the primary and the backup exchange `owed` BGT, but the `withdraw()` function only transfers from the primary exchange and increments the primary exchange's `withdrawn` variable by the full amount. As a result, users cannot access backup-held BGT if the primary exchange is underfunded. This will lead to the user's withdrawal reverting, and the user cannot withdraw their entire amount. 

### Root Cause

In the following code snippet: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L72-L87 the `getOwed()` function sums both the primary and backup exchange's total `owed` amount, however, the `withdraw()` function only updates the primary exchange's`withdrawn[msg.sender]` and only transfers its own balance. There is no mechanism or interface in place for the primary contract to trigger a withdrawal from the backup contract for the user. 

Suppose the user is `owed` tokens in both the primary exchange and the backup exchange, and the total `owed` is bigger than the funds existing in the primary exchange. In that case, the call will revert, and the user will be unable to recover their full `owed` amount.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin sets a backup exchanger via `setBackup(address)` on the primary contract.
2. User accrues BGT owed in both primary and backup exchangers.
3. User calls `withdraw(user, totalOwed)` where totalOwed > primaryOwed. (The total owed is the total amount for the primary and backup exchanges.)

### External Pre-conditions

Both primary and backup contracts are funded with BGT, but the primary exchange's balance is less than the user's total `owed`.

### Attack Path

1. Setup:
* `primary.owed[user] = 60`, `backup.owed[user] = 40`, `primary.withdrawn[user] = 0` //note that this is only pseudo-code to easier distinguish between the variables in the primary and the backup
* Both contracts are funded with 80 BGT each (the primary exchange's total balance is 80 BGT, and the backup exchange's balance is 80 BGT each).
2. User checks total owed:
* `getOwed(user) = 60 (primary) + 40 (backup) - 0 (withdrawn) = 100`
* The user is `owed` 100 BGT.
3. User calls `primary.withdraw(user, 100)`, which is their total owed amount:
* `primary.withdrawn[user] += 100`
* The contract tries to transfer 100 BGT from primary, but only 80 are available.
* The transaction reverts.
4. User receives nothing: 
* There is no way for the user to withdraw just the 60 from primary and then the 40 from backup via the primary exchange (e.g., their entire `owed ' amount), since the 40 BGT in backup is inaccessible through the main interface.


### Impact
- **User loss**: If the primary exchange is underfunded, users cannot recover their full balance, even though backup exchange funds exist.
- **Stranded funds**: Backup exchange BGT is locked and cannot be accessed via the primary exchange.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Split withdrawal logic:** Pay only the primary slice from the primary exchange and increment `withdrawn`by that slice alone.
2. **Add a `withdrawFor()` function to backup exchange interface:** 
```solidity
   function withdrawFor(address caller, address recipient, uint256 amount) external;
```
3. **Cascade the remainder:** after paying the primary slice, call 
```solidity
   backupEx.withdrawFor(msg.sender, recipient, backupSlice);
```
to transfer backup-held BGT and keep protocol accounting correct, ensuring users can always recover their full balance regardless of primary exchange's funding.
