# [M-1] Invalid Island Range Check Prevents Contract Initialization

name: wispy
description: Optional island address validation will cause contract initialization to fail when no island is provided
labels: [bug, Medium]

## Summary

The incorrect validation of optional island address in `Burve.sol` will cause contract initialization to fail as the protocol will revert with `InvalidIslandRange()` when no island address is provided


## Root Cause

In `Burve.sol` the validation logic for optional island address is incorrect. When no island address is provided (0x0), the code still checks for `isIsland()` on ranges, causing the initialization to revert with `InvalidIslandRange()`. This happens because:



1. When `_island` is 0x0, `hasIsland` is set to false (line 145)
2. The first if block is skipped (lines 164-169), which means:
   - No ranges are added to the `ranges` array
   - `rangeIndex` remains at 0
3. The code enters the while loop (line 173)
4. The first range is checked with `isIsland()` (line 176)
5. Even though no island was provided, the check still reverts with `InvalidIslandRange()`


## Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol needs to initialize Burve contract
2. No island address is provided (0x0)
3. Ranges are provided in the constructor

## External Pre-conditions

1. The Uniswap V3 pool must be properly initialized
2. The provided ranges must be valid for the pool's tick spacing


## Attack Path

1. Protocol attempts to initialize Burve contract without providing an island address
2. `hasIsland` is set to false due to 0x0 address (line 145)
3. Code skips the island range check in the first if block (lines 164-169)
4. Code enters the while loop with `rangeIndex = 0` (line 173)
5. First range is checked with `isIsland()` (line 176)
6. Contract reverts with `InvalidIslandRange()`
7. Contract initialization fails


## Impact

The protocol cannot be initialized without an island address, breaking core contract functionality. This prevents:
- Deployment of new Burve instances
- Proper initialization of the contract
- Usage of the protocol without an island

## Mitigation

Modify the validation logic to only check for `isIsland()` when an island address is provided:

```diff

    // Only check for island if we have an island address
-     if (range.isIsland()) {
+    if (hasIsland && range.isIsland()) {
        revert InvalidIslandRange();
    }

```


This ensures that island validation only occurs when an island address is actually provided.
