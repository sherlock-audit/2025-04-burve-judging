# The BGT balance in `BGTExchanger` can be sniped to arbitrage.

### Summary

root cause: Berachain block time is 2 seconds, so if price is volatile in some sessions, MEV bots will be the first tx in every block doing transactions even before the owner’s `BGTExchanger.setRate()` even if they decide to set rate every block.

Main cause: Lack of exchange fees or withdrawal delay is the reason or not using push-based oracle pricing system like pyth.

There will be times, the price of BGT is so volatile. It moves in % in few milli seconds. In this time, users will arbitrage the BGT balances in `BGTExchanger` contract.

### Root Cause

Root cause is, the exchange of tokens for BGT depends on the `setRate()` call made by owner. But the thing is, unlike chainlink or pyth oracles where you can’t MEV extract the oracle changes because they are very frequent and fast..,

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions
BGT price is volatile

### Attack Path

Prices in dexes/crypto moves faster in milli-sec latency. Only pyth/redstone oracles keep up to these levels.So, as simple, setRate() can’t keep up with the change in volatile prices, and this allows users to snipe the BGT for less $$ than it price outside. Or sell the BGT at higher price.

1. Lets say BGT set rate for USDC `in token` = 10 $$. But the price is very volatile and it moves to $11 in a second.
2. Now, the MEV bots will pull 100 USDC flashloan, then exchange for BGT at an un-updated $10 for 10 BGT tokens. 
3. Then sell these 10 BGT tokens for 110 USDC in dexes and repay 100 usdc flashloan.

```solidity
    function exchange(
        address inToken, uint128 amount
    ) external returns (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) {
        if (!isExchanger[msg.sender]) revert NoExchangePermissions();

        (bgtAmount, spendAmount) = viewExchange(inToken, amount);
        if (bgtAmount > 0) {
            bgtBalance -= bgtAmount;
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom( // We take what we need.
                    inToken,
                    msg.sender,
                    address(this),
                    spendAmount
                );
            owed[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
        }
    }

    function setRate(address inToken, uint256 rateX128) external {
        AdminLib.validateOwner();
        rate[inToken] = rateX128;
    }

    function viewExchange(
        address inToken, uint128 amount
    ) public view returns (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) {
        // If rate is zero, the spendAmount remains zero.
        bgtAmount = FullMath.mulX128(rate[inToken], amount, false);

        if (bgtBalance < bgtAmount) {
            bgtAmount = bgtBalance;
            // Rate won't be zero here or else bgtAmount is 0 and can't be more.
            amount = uint128(
                FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(bgtAmount, 1 << 128, rate[inToken])
            );
        }

        if (bgtAmount != 0) {
            spendAmount = amount;
        }
    }

```

### Impact
Loss of BGT tokens from `BGTExchanger`. Loss to the BGT funders. loss of funds. But only in volatile times.

### PoC
NA

### Mitigation
Add exchange fees or exchange delay. Or use Pyth oracles to use push+pull based oracle system. Most low latent oracles out there.
