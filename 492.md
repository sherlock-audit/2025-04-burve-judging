# A portion of rewards will be accumulated to burned shares and get lost

### Summary
A portion of earned rewards (per non-bgt) are allocated to the burned reserves and locked inside reserve closure (cid of 0), this is because the initial burned value is still taken into account when calculating new rewards

### Root Cause
When a closure is first deployed, `ClosureImpl.init()` seeds each token with a tiny balance (target) “burned” :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L80-L106
That burned amount is added to `valueStaked` even though no address can ever redeem it:
```solidity
        // Tiny burned value.
        self.valueStaked += target * self.n;
```
Later, when earnings are credited:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L741-L742
```solidity
        // All pools start with non-zero nonbgtvalue
        self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] += (earnings << 128) / nonBgtValueStaked;
```
The denominator (`valueStaked − bgtValueStaked`) therefore includes the burned seed.
Every fee or vault yield is divided among real LP value plus the phantom burn value, so a percentage of rewards is lost forever.

### Internal Pre-conditions
- The initial `stakedValue` is > 0

### External Pre-conditions
- Fees accrue (swaps, single-token adds/removes) or external yield is trimmed from vaults at any time after deployment.

### Attack Path
_No response_

### Impact
In the long-term, Pool accumulates an ever-growing pot of unclaimable reserve shares
Although the initial target is small, over long periods the cumulative lost yield becomes non-negligible.
