# `Burve`'s multi-pool won't work with vaults that charge fees

### Summary

Based on `Burve`'s vault implementation, the protocol expects to have vaults that have [fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L56-L58):

```solidity
    function fetch(
        VaultE4626 storage self,
        VaultTemp memory temp
    ) internal view {
        temp.vars[0] = self.vault.previewRedeem(self.totalVaultShares); // Total assets
        temp.vars[3] = self.vault.previewRedeem(
            self.vault.previewDeposit(1 << 128)
        ); // X128 fee discount factor.
    }
```

From the above, we can see that the vaults set a fee factor based on the vault's deposit and withdrawal fees. However, because of this, closures that use these vaults will always produce issues, as the vault amounts will always differ from the internal protocol balances.

### Root Cause

Due to the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L71-L74) in the `Vertex`, vaults that have fees will always produce balances that are less than the ones that are set in the vertex internal balance, leading to `trim` actions to produce the `InsufficientBalance` event, potentially locking the vertex. From then on, if a user tries to withdraw any value or tokens from such a vault, the action will revert, as the protocol's internal balance bookkeeping will try to transfer more funds to the user than what is taken from the vault due to fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User adds value to a closure that utilizes vaults with fees.
2. User tries to remove value.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

When adding value to the closure, the `trimBalance()` function will emit the `InsufficientBalance` event, potentially locking the vertex. If the closure is still active and the user tries to remove value, the transaction will revert as `Burve` will get fewer assets from the vault than what the user will require due to vault fees.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

The issue fix is not straightforward, as it will require reworking of how the internal balance is set in regards to vaults with fees.
