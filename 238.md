# Malicious StationProxy or Island Token will Drain Tokens and Shares from Users and Protocol.

### Summary

The external call to stationProxy.withdrawLP before updating ERC20 balances in super._update will cause a reentrancy vulnerability for the contract as a malicious from contract will reenter the _update function to manipulate islandSharesPerOwner based on outdated balances.

### Root Cause

In ``Burve.sol:724 - 735``, the external call to stationProxy.withdrawLP is made before updating ERC20 balances in super._update, allowing a malicious from contract to reenter and manipulate islandSharesPerOwner with outdated balance values.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A numbered list of conditions to allow the reentrancy attack path to occur:

- The `from address` needs to be a malicious contract to execute a reentrant call to the `_update` function during the `stationProxy.withdrawLP` call.
- The contract needs to have `islandSharesPerOwner[from]` to be at least a non-zero value to allow a non-zero `islandTransfer` calculation.
- The contract needs to have `balanceOf(from)` to be at least a non-zero value to ensure the FullMath.mulDiv calculation in `_update` does not revert or return zero.
- The `stationProxy` contract needs to allow the `withdrawLP` function to trigger a callback or hook (directly or via the island token) to enable the malicious from contract to reenter the `_update` function.

### External Pre-conditions

A numbered list of conditions in external protocols required to enable the reentrancy attack path:

- The `stationProxy` contract needs to implement `withdrawLP` to trigger a token transfer or callback in the `island` token that allows the from address to execute arbitrary code.
- The `stationProxy` contract needs to allow `withdrawLP` to process the withdrawal without reentrancy protections, enabling the from address to reenter the calling contract before the `_update` function completes.

### Attack Path

1. The malicious from contract calls transfer (inherited from ERC20) on the Burve contract, triggering `_update` function, which updates islandSharesPerOwner.
2. The `Burve` contract calls `stationProxy.withdrawLP`, triggering a callback in the `island` token that executes code in the malicious from contract.
3. The `from` contract reenters `_update` via `transfer`, using the outdated `balanceOf(from)` to `withdraw` additional `islandSharesPerOwner[from]` shares.
The `from` contract repeats this within the transaction, draining excessive shares until gas or other limits are reached.

### Impact

The `Burve` contract suffers an approximate loss of excessive `islandSharesPerOwner` shares drained from legitimate users. The attacker gains these shares by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability.

### Mitigation

```javascript
function _update(address from, address to, uint256 value) internal virtual override {
    if (from != address(0) && to != address(0) && address(island) != address(0)) {
        uint256 islandTransfer = FullMath.mulDiv(
            islandSharesPerOwner[from],
            value,
            balanceOf(from)
        );
        islandSharesPerOwner[from] -= islandTransfer;
        islandSharesPerOwner[to] += islandTransfer;
    }
    super._update(from, to, value); // Update balances first
    if (from != address(0) && to != address(0) && address(island) != address(0)) {
        stationProxy.withdrawLP(address(island), islandTransfer, from);
        SafeERC20.forceApprove(island, address(stationProxy), islandTransfer);
        stationProxy.depositLP(address(island), islandTransfer, to);
        SafeERC20.forceApprove(island, address(stationProxy), 0);
    }
}
