# Inflated `shares` & `totalNominalLiq` when the `island.getMintAmounts()` accepts fewer tokens than requested

### Summary

Missing reconciliation between requested and actually-minted liquidity in the Island branch of `mint()` will cause an **over-minting of pool shares** and **skew the percentage allocation among ranges**; any minter can steal assets from all other LPs and violate the contract’s `distX96` distribution.

`island.getMintAmounts()` may accept less liquidity than requested → Burve still counts the full amount in `totalNominalLiq` and `shares` →  
1. Attacker later burns and withdraws more from non-Island ranges than funded.  
2. `distX96` no longer reflects reality (e.g. Island meant to hold 20 % but holds less), breaking internal assumptions for fee accounting, rebalancing, and strategy UIs.

### Root Cause

In [`mintIsland()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L296)  
  ```solidity
  (uint256 mint0, uint256 mint1, uint256 mintShares) = island.getMintAmounts(amount0, amount1);
  ```  
  The call may **return smaller `mintShares`** because the Island enforces its current
  deposit ratio [see Kodiak docs](https://documentation.kodiak.finance/developers/kodiak-islands/technical-integration-guide/understanding-token-deposit-ratio#depositing-with-both-tokens). Meaning that maybe less token will be used to mint and so less liquidity minted on the UniV3 pool.

Nevertheless, upstream [`mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226) still treats the *original* `liqInRange` (derived from `mintNominalLiq`) as if it had been minted:

  ```solidity
  uint128 liqInRange = uint128(shift96(uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true));
  ...
  // shares = mintNominalLiq * totalShares / totalNominalLiq
  totalNominalLiq += mintNominalLiq;          // ✅ counted
  ```

  No adjustment is performed with the **real number** of tokens that were *actually* consumed for island range.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `totalShares > 0` so the proportional share formula is used.

### External Pre-conditions

1. `island.getMintAmounts()` returns `mint0 & mint1< amount0 & amount1`.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `mint()` with a large `mintNominalLiq`.
2. Inside the Island, only a fraction of the requested tokens match the
   current ratio; the remainder is silently rejected.
3. Burve still increments `totalNominalLiq` by the full `mintNominalLiq`
   and mints the attacker **excess `shares`**.
4. Attacker immediately calls `burn()`:
   * `burnLiqNominal = shares * totalNominalLiq / totalShares`  
     → inflated because numerator (`shares`) is too high **and**
     denominator (`totalNominalLiq`) was over-counted.
   * Non-Island Uniswap V3 ranges are withdrawn proportionally,
     sending the attacker more tokens that he deposited.
5. Net result: other LPs’ positions are diluted; their future withdrawals
   are reduced.

### Impact

* Honest LPs lose amount held in non-Island ranges as shares of attacker is bigger than expected.  
* `totalNominalLiq`, `totalShares`, and each range’s implied weight are corrupted

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

1. After `island.getMintAmounts()` returns, compute the actual liquidity
   contributed and return that value.
2. In `mint()` :
   * Replace `liqInRange` by the *real* liquidity minted to the Island.
   * Increment `totalNominalLiq` with that real value.
   * Mint `shares` proportional to real liquidity.
