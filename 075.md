# Frequent removeSingleForValue withdrawals will cause value loss impacting Users

### Summary

The `testDustLossWithManyWithdrawals` test highlights a potential source of value leakage within the protocol on the [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L248) `ValueFacet::removeSingleForValue` . While the test uses a single user (Alice) for demonstration, the underlying issue affects *any* user interacting with the system in a specific pattern.

1.  **Scenario:** Users deposit value into closures (e.g., closure `0xF`) supporting multiple tokens. Subsequently, instead of withdrawing desired amounts in single batch transactions (`removeValue`), numerous users opt to withdraw their funds incrementally through many separate `removeSingleForValue` transactions, specifying small `tokenAmountPerIteration` amounts each time.
2.  **Comparison:** Users who withdraw the same total value in a single batch `removeValue` transaction recover their entire deposit without loss.
3.  **Observation:** Each `removeSingleForValue` call incurs minor precision loss. When aggregated across many such calls *by many different users*, the cumulative effect leads to a noticeable pool of value dust being left behind and locked within the protocol's contracts. 

### Root Cause

The value loss stems from the cumulative effect of precision loss and rounding errors inherent in the internal calculations performed by the `removeSingleForValue` function when converting requested `tokenAmount` to its equivalent `value`. While negligible in a single call, these discrepancies accumulate over many repeated calls (whether by one user or many), leading to value dust remaining in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   Users have deposited value into specific closures within the system.
*   The closures support multiple underlying tokens.


### External Pre-conditions

*   Sufficient user activity involving frequent, small withdrawals via `removeSingleForValue`.

### Attack Path

This describes a path to value loss experienced by users interacting with the system in a specific way, leading to systemic value lockup:

1.  Multiple users deposit value into multi-token closures.
2.  Instead of withdrawing desired amounts using single `removeValue` calls, these users collectively perform numerous incremental withdrawals using `removeSingleForValue`, specifying small token amounts.
3.  Each `removeSingleForValue` call across the user base contributes a small amount of precision loss (dust).
4.  Over time and across many users, the cumulative precision loss results in a non-trivial aggregate amount of user value becoming inaccessible (dust) within the protocol's contracts.

### Impact

**Medium Severity (Systemically):** While the direct value loss for any single user performing a few withdrawals is small , the cumulative effect across the entire protocol can become significant. If many users frequently interact via small `removeSingleForValue` withdrawals, the aggregated dust can represent a substantial amount of locked capital belonging to users but trapped within the system. This constitutes a systemic inefficiency and capital lockup issue (medium severity), degrading the overall capital efficiency and user experience of the protocol, even though it doesn't represent a direct theft vector.
