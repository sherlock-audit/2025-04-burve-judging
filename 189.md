# In zero fee closures it is profitable to swap multiple small amounts than a one big amount

### Summary

When swapping(exactOut) tokens in SwapFacet.sol it is more profitable to do multiple small swaps than one big swap in zero fee closures.

### Root Cause

In [`swap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L52-L146) whenever there are no closure fees and `addValueSingle` is not called after initialisation of closure anytime you call exact out swap with smaller amounts, you are given the exact amount you swapped but if you try with bigger sums you won't get the exact amount you swapped, you will get less, making it more profitable when you do multiple small swaps. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. No closure fees are set
2. Closure balance must be at least 5x swap amount


### External Pre-conditions

1. value should not been added to the closure after initialisation i.e `addValueSingle` has been called.
2. If value is added the same amount added should be removed

### Attack Path

1. Swap with smaller amounts till you get your desired amount.
2. add all small amounts together and compare it with one big swap you'd realise the former is more profitable

### Impact

Users will gain more profit from swapping smaller amounts cumulatively to get their desired amount than swapping all their desired amount at once

### PoC

add this test to `test/facets/SwapFacet.t.sol`

```solidity

    function testExactOutputSwap2() public {
        uint256 swapAmount = 23e9; 
        uint256 beforeBalance0 = token0.balanceOf(alice);
        uint256 beforeBalance1 = token1.balanceOf(alice);

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount) = swapFacet.swap(
            alice, // recipient
            tokens[0], // tokenIn
            tokens[1], // tokenOut
            -int256(swapAmount), // negative for exact out
            type(uint256).max, // no price limit
            0x3
        );
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertEq(outAmount, swapAmount);

        console.log("inAmount: ", inAmount);
        console.log("outAmount: ", outAmount);
    }
```
Note this bug is more profitable with exact Out swaps

observe that in the logs printed;
`outAmount == inAmount` for exact out swaps

### Mitigation

Check swap implementation to offer a fair mechanism
