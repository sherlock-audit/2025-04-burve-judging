# BGT tokens will be locked in BGTExchanger as the contract withdraws only portion of the bgt tokens users earned

### Summary

Users can earn bgt tokens when they add values and get earnings in closure.
But there is an error in calculation of the bgtBalance in `Asset.sol`.
Therefore the users will get only portion of bgt tokens they earned and the tokens will be locked in **BGTExchanger**.

### Root Cause

When the user gets earnings through `addEarnings()` in `Closure.sol`, it can earn bgttokens and later the user can collect earnings in `ValueFacet.sol`.
In `ValueFacet.sol`, it will call `claimFees()` of `Asset.sol` to collect bgt balance but it's less than expected.

```solidity
Closure.sol
if (self.bgtValueStaked > 0) {
    // Round BGT take down.
    uint256 bgtExAmount = (userAmount * self.bgtValueStaked) /
        self.valueStaked;
    uint256 bgtEarned;
    (bgtEarned, unspent) = SimplexLib.bgtExchange(idx, bgtExAmount); // some bgt tokens are earned
    self.bgtPerBgtValueX128 += (bgtEarned << 128) / self.bgtValueStaked;
    userAmount -= bgtExAmount;
}
```

In `asset.sol`, it calls `collect()` at the beginning of `add()` function.
Here it adds bgtBalance and updates the bgtPerValueX128Check from closure.

```solidity
Asset.sol
a.bgtBalance += FullMath.mulX128(
    bpvX128 - a.bgtPerValueX128Check,
    a.bgtValue, // bgtValue is not updated yet, so it's still 0
    false
);
```

But `asset.bgtValue` is not updated yet, so there is an error in this logic.

### Attack Path

1. let's assume they add bgtEarned 100 each time with bgtValue = 1000.
```solidity
    (bgtEarned, unspent) = SimplexLib.bgtExchange(idx, bgtExAmount); // bgtEarned is 100
    self.bgtPerBgtValueX128 += (bgtEarned << 128) / self.bgtValueStaked; // selft.bgtValueStaked will increase 1000 each time
```

2. And the user gets earnings three times.
```solidity
| bgtEarned | bgtStaked | bgtPerValueX128Check | bgtValue (Asset.sol)  | bgtBalance (Asset.sol)  | Notes                                            |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 100       | 1000      | 0.1                  | 0                     | 0                       | Lost 100                                         |
| 100       | 2000      | 0.15                 | 1000                  | 50                      | Lost 50 — added (0.15 - 0.1) * 1000 = 50         |
| 100       | 3000      | 0.183                | 2000                  | 116.67                  | Lost 33 — added (0.183 - 0.15) * 2000 = 66.67    |
```

3. When the user tries to collect earnings(), he will get only 116.67 instead of 300.

### Impact

The staker suffers a loss of earned BGT rewards proportional to the missed distribution. The protocol does not gain these tokens — they remain locked in the BGTExchanger, becoming inaccessible, which may accumulate to a large systemic loss over time.

### PoC

Add below line to `ValueFacet.sol` to replicate this issue easier.
```solidity
    realTax = 1000; // added
    c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
```

Add below test function to `ValueFacet.t.sol`.
```solidity
function testAddSingleForValueAndBgtCollection() public {
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    _installBGTExchanger();
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Step 1: Set up parameters
    address token = tokens[2];
    uint16 closureId = 0xF;
    uint128 value = 1e19;
    uint128 bgtValue = 5e18;

    // Step 2: Perform addSingleForValue actions, it will add the values to bob
    valueFacet.addValueSingle(bob, closureId, value, bgtValue, token, 0);
    valueFacet.addValueSingle(bob, closureId, value, bgtValue, token, 0);
    valueFacet.addValueSingle(bob, closureId, value, bgtValue, token, 0);

    // Step 3: Bob tries to collect earnings
    vm.startPrank(bob);
    (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory collectedBalances, uint256 collectedBgt) = valueFacet.collectEarnings(bob, closureId);
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    uint256 bgtOwed = bgtEx.getOwed(diamond);
    console.log("Owed", bgtOwed);
    assertEq(bgtOwed, 0, "Collect earnings should withdraw all bgt tokens");
}
```
