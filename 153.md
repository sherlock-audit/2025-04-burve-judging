# Zero-reverting ERC-20 will permanently DoS liquidity providers

### Summary

Unconditional zero-value `transfer/transferFrom` calls in Burve will revert for ERC-20s that forbid zero transfers, causing every mint/burn/compound to revert once price exits at least one managed range. Liquidity remains locked until price re-enters the range or the contract is upgraded.

### Root Cause

In `Burve.sol`, multiple token moves are executed without checking `amount != 0`, which means that the tokens will revert if `amount == 0`. The following can be seen here:
- uniswapV3MintCallback() https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L828-L840
- mintIsland() https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L316-L327

Tokens known to behave revert on zero-value transfers include LON (`0x000…c952)`, XSGD (`0x70e8…`), RING (`0x9469…`), MEME (`0xd552…`), AMN (`0x737f…`).

When pool price is fully outside a tick-range, one side of the owed amount is zero → call reverts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Deployer selects a token that reverts on zero amounts (e.g. LON) as `token0` or `token1`.
2. At least one Burve tick-range lies completely above or below current price so that `amount0Owed == 0` or `amount1Owed == 0`.

### External Pre-conditions

Normal price movement pushes spot price outside the affected tick-range.

### Attack Path

1. Any user calls `mint()`.
2. `compoundV3Ranges()` triggers; for the out-of-price range the pool calls `uniswapV3MintCallback(amount0>0, 0)`.
3. Burve executes `safeTransferFrom(token1, … , 0)` → LON (or similar) reverts.
4. Entire transaction reverts.
5. Subsequent `mint, burn`, or automated compounding hits the same path and reverts until price re-enters every range.

### Impact

Liquidity providers cannot add/remove liquidity, collect fees, or compound; capital is stranded until the contract is upgraded or price crosses back into every managed range. No direct monetary gain for an attacker, but a protocol-wide denial-of-service.

Approximate loss: unquantifiable opportunity cost; users’ funds remain locked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a zero-amount check inside of the `TransferHelper.sol`

```diff
// inside TransferHelper
    function safeTransferFrom(
        address token,
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 value
    ) internal {
+     if (value == 0) return; /// ← NEW: skip zero moves
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IERC20.transferFrom.selector,
                from,
                to,
                value
            )
        );
        require( //@audit-info success is the low-level call succeeded flag from the actual call function
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            "STF"
        );
    }

    function safeTransfer(address token, address to, uint256 value) internal {
+    if (value == 0) return; /// ← NEW: skip zero moves
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = token.call(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector, to, value)
        );
        require(
            success && (data.length == 0 || abi.decode(data, (bool))),
            "ST"
        );
    }
```
