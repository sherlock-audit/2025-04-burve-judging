# Zero Target Vulnerability in SimplexFacet.addClosure Can Lead to Division by Zero Errors

## Summary
The `addClosure` function in the SimplexFacet contract contains a critical vulnerability that allows setting a zero `initTarget` value, which can lead to division by zero errors in multiple functions throughout the protocol. This deterministic bug can cause transactions to revert, potentially blocking critical protocol operations and leading to permanent loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `addClosure` function of the SimplexFacet contract, there is a check to ensure that the `startingTarget` parameter is not less than the `initTarget` value stored in the Simplex struct. However, there is no validation to ensure that `initTarget` itself is non-zero.

From `src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol#L195-L239:

```solidity
function addClosure(
    uint16 _cid,
    uint128 startingTarget,
    uint128 baseFeeX128,
    uint128 protocolTakeX128
) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();

    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_cid);
    // We fetch the raw storage because Store.closure would check the closure for initialization.
    Closure storage c = Store.load().closures[cid];

    uint256 initTarget = Store.simplex().initTarget;
    if (startingTarget < initTarget) {
        revert InsufficientStartingTarget(startingTarget, initTarget);
    }

    uint256[MAX_TOKENS] storage neededBalances = c.init(
        cid,
        startingTarget,
        baseFeeX128,
        protocolTakeX128
    );
    
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

The issue is that the `initTarget` value can be set to zero through the `setInitTarget` function in the SimplexLib library:

From `src/multi/Simplex.sol`:

```solidity
function setInitTarget(uint256 target) internal {
    Store.simplex().initTarget = target;
}
```

As shown in the test file `test/multi/Simplex.t.sol`, it's possible to set `initTarget` to zero:

```solidity
function testSetInitTarget() public {
    SimplexLib.setInitTarget(2e18);
    assertEq(SimplexLib.getInitTarget(), 2e18);

    SimplexLib.setInitTarget(0);
    assertEq(SimplexLib.getInitTarget(), 0);

    SimplexLib.setInitTarget(1e6);
    assertEq(SimplexLib.getInitTarget(), 1e6);
}
```

If `initTarget` is set to zero, then `startingTarget` can also be zero (since the check `startingTarget < initTarget` would pass for `startingTarget = 0`). This would lead to a closure being initialized with a zero target value, which can cause division by zero errors in multiple functions throughout the protocol, particularly in the ValueLib functions that perform calculations based on the target value.

For example, in the `Closure.stakeValue` function, there's a calculation that divides by the target value:

```solidity
function stakeValue(
    Closure storage self,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue
) internal {
    trimAllBalances(self);
    uint256 maxValue = (self.targetX128 * self.n) >> 128;
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

If `targetX128` is zero (which would be the case if `startingTarget` is zero), then `maxValue` would also be zero. While this specific calculation doesn't cause a division by zero, it can lead to unexpected behavior in other parts of the code that assume `maxValue` is non-zero.

More critically, in the ValueLib functions like `v` and `x`, there are calculations that use the target value as a denominator, which would revert if the target is zero.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Transaction Failures**: Any transaction that relies on calculations involving the target value will revert if the target is zero, potentially blocking critical protocol operations.

2. **Denial of Service**: Core protocol operations like adding or removing tokens, or calculating swap amounts, may fail if they involve closures with zero target values.

3. **Permanent Fund Loss**: If users are unable to interact with a closure due to this issue, they may be forced to use other, less optimal paths, potentially leading to financial losses.

4. **Protocol Instability**: The inconsistent state between closures with zero and non-zero target values can lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol, potentially affecting other operations.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur if `initTarget` is set to zero
- It directly affects core protocol functionality
- It can lead to transaction failures and potential fund loss
- It has no workaround once a closure is created with a zero target value

## Proof of Concept
Consider the following scenario:

1. The protocol owner calls `SimplexLib.setInitTarget(0)` to set the `initTarget` to zero.
2. The protocol owner then calls `SimplexFacet.addClosure` with `startingTarget = 0`, which passes the check `startingTarget < initTarget`.
3. A closure is created with a zero target value.
4. Users attempt to interact with the closure, but transactions revert due to division by zero errors in the ValueLib functions.

This scenario can be demonstrated with the following test:

```solidity
function testZeroTargetVulnerability() public {
    // Set initTarget to zero
    SimplexLib.setInitTarget(0);
    
    // Create a closure with startingTarget = 0
    simplexFacet.addClosure(0x3, 0, 0, 0);
    
    // Attempt to interact with the closure
    // This will revert due to division by zero in ValueLib functions
    vm.expectRevert();
    valueFacet.addValue(address(this), 0x3, 100e18, 0);
}
```

## Root Cause3
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of validation to ensure that `initTarget` is non-zero before allowing closures to be created. The `setInitTarget` function allows setting `initTarget` to zero, and the `addClosure` function only checks that `startingTarget` is not less than `initTarget`, but doesn't ensure that either value is non-zero.

## Code Snippet
From `src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.soll#L195-L239:

```solidity
function addClosure(
    uint16 _cid,
    uint128 startingTarget,
    uint128 baseFeeX128,
    uint128 protocolTakeX128
) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();

    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_cid);
    // We fetch the raw storage because Store.closure would check the closure for initialization.
    Closure storage c = Store.load().closures[cid];

    uint256 initTarget = Store.simplex().initTarget;
    if (startingTarget < initTarget) {
        revert InsufficientStartingTarget(startingTarget, initTarget);
    }

    uint256[MAX_TOKENS] storage neededBalances = c.init(
        cid,
        startingTarget,
        baseFeeX128,
        protocolTakeX128
    );
    
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

From `src/multi/Simplex.sol`:

```solidity
function setInitTarget(uint256 target) internal {
    Store.simplex().initTarget = target;
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several approaches to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Add a Non-Zero Check in setInitTarget**: Modify the `setInitTarget` function to ensure that the target is non-zero:

```solidity
function setInitTarget(uint256 target) internal {
    require(target > 0, "InitTarget must be non-zero");
    Store.simplex().initTarget = target;
}
```

2. **Add a Non-Zero Check in addClosure**: Modify the `addClosure` function to ensure that both `initTarget` and `startingTarget` are non-zero:

```solidity
function addClosure(
    uint16 _cid,
    uint128 startingTarget,
    uint128 baseFeeX128,
    uint128 protocolTakeX128
) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();

    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_cid);
    // We fetch the raw storage because Store.closure would check the closure for initialization.
    Closure storage c = Store.load().closures[cid];

    uint256 initTarget = Store.simplex().initTarget;
    require(initTarget > 0, "InitTarget must be non-zero");
    if (startingTarget < initTarget) {
        revert InsufficientStartingTarget(startingTarget, initTarget);
    }

    uint256[MAX_TOKENS] storage neededBalances = c.init(
        cid,
        startingTarget,
        baseFeeX128,
        protocolTakeX128
    );
    
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

3. **Set a Minimum Value for initTarget in the Constructor**: Ensure that `initTarget` is initialized with a non-zero value in the constructor and cannot be changed to zero:

```solidity
function init(string memory _name, string memory _symbol, address _adjustor) internal {
    Simplex storage s = Store.simplex();
    s.name = _name;
    s.symbol = _symbol;
    s.adjustor = _adjustor;
    s.initTarget = DEFAULT_INIT_TARGET; // Ensure this is non-zero
    s.searchParams.maxIter = 5;
    s.searchParams.deMinimusX128 = 100;
    s.searchParams.targetSlippageX128 = 1e12;
}
```

Option 1 is the simplest and most direct fix, as it addresses the immediate issue without requiring complex changes to the protocol's logic.
