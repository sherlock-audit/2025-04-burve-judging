# Missing Slippage Protection in `BGTExchanger::exchange` fucntion.

### Summary

The `BGTExchanger::exchange()` function lacks slippage protection, allowing a user to receive an unfair amount of BGT during volatile price changes between the configured rate token (e.g., USDC) and the input token (e.g., WETH). This opens the protocol to manipulation and drop in value, especially in rapidly changing market conditions.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L31-L48

The function calculates the BGT output (`bgtAmount`) via viewExchange(`inToken`, `amount`) using a static rate (`rate[inToken]`) set by the contract owner. However, the actual transfer of the input token occurs after the rate-based calculation, creating a time-of-check to time-of-use window. Since there is no mechanism to enforce price slippage bounds, the transaction is sensitive to price fluctuations between WETH and USDC (or other configured tokens).

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The `rate[inToken]` is set manually by the owner (e.g., 2 BGT per 1 USDC).
- The exchange contract maintains a balance of BGT to fulfill exchanges.
- The user is marked as an authorized isExchanger.

### External Pre-conditions

- The user initiates an exchange by depositing a volatile token (e.g., WETH).
- The user has approved() the exchange contract to spend their tokens.
- Market prices of BGT, USDC, or WETH are volatile or manipulable.

### Attack Path

- User initiate a transaction using WETH as inToken, expecting to receive BGT at the set rate.
- Before the transaction completes (or within the same block via MEV), the price of WETH increases (or BGT/USDC increases), making the calculated bgtAmount undervalued relative to real market conditions.
- The user completes the transaction and receives lesser BGT than anticipated.

### Impact

- Economic loss to the user: Users can receive less BGT than anticipated.
- Lack of trust to the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add slippage protection: Require users to specify a minimum acceptable bgtAmountOut as part of the function call and revert if the calculated value is below it.
```solidity
function exchange(address inToken, uint128 amount, uint256 minBgtOut) external returns (...) {
    ...
    require(bgtAmount >= minBgtOut, "Slippage limit exceeded");
}
```
