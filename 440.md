# Flawed net‑off arithmetic in VaultE4626.commit() lets a single withdrawal out‑weigh a smaller deposit and steal the difference

### Summary

Incorrect subtraction ordering in the “withdraw > deposit” branch will cause over‑withdrawal and share inflation for all future users because any closure batching withdraw > deposit in the same commit zeroes the deposit first, then performs the full withdrawal, siphoning (w − d) tokens from the vault.


### Root Cause

In [E4626.sol ‑ VaultE4626.commit() lines 31‑46] the netting code path is:
```solidity 
else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToDeposit = 0;                 // deposit wiped
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit; // subtracts 0 (no netting)
}
```
Because assetsToDeposit is set to 0 before the subtraction, the intended net effect is lost; the vault executes a full withdraw(assetsToWithdraw) while depositing nothing. Storage variables (totalVaultShares, totalShares) are updated as if the netting had happened, creating a persistent accounting mismatch.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Within a single batching cycle, some closure sets
assetsToDeposit = d > 0 and assetsToWithdraw = w > d.
(Occurs whenever two closures operate in opposite directions in the same block.)


2. The ERC‑4626 vault honours withdraw(w).



### External Pre-conditions

None. No oracle, keeper, or governance action is required.

### Attack Path


1. Attacker controls two closures (A, B) that share the same vertex/vault.


2. In one transaction

1. Vertex.deposit via closure A for d = 1 wei.


2. Vertex.withdraw via closure B for w = vaultBalance – 1 wei.




3. VaultProxy.commit() calls VaultE4626.commit() with
assetsToDeposit = 1 wei, assetsToWithdraw ≈ vaultBalance.


4. The buggy branch zeroes assetsToDeposit then subtracts zero, leaving the full withdrawal.


5. vault.withdraw(w) executes; self.totalVaultShares is decreased by the full share amount, but no assets are deposited.


6. Closure B receives nearly the entire vault balance; closure A retains its new shares backed by nothing.


7. Repeat until vault drained.




### Impact

Liquidity inside the ERC‑4626 vault is steadily stolen; honest LPs’ totalVaultShares no longer match underlying assets.

Subsequent withdrawals from legitimate users will revert or deliver less, effectively draining the vault to zero for negligible attacker cost (gas only).


### PoC

```solidity
function testNetOffExploit() public {
    uint256 full = 10_000 ether; // vault seeded
    uint256 dust = 1;

    // set balances
    deal(address(token), address(vault), full);

    // attacker controls two closures
    proxy.deposit(cidA, dust);                  // tiny deposit
    proxy.withdraw(cidB, full - dust + 1);      // > active balance

    vm.expectRevert();                          // commit reverts if vault guards, otherwise passes
    proxy.commit();                             // hits flawed branch

    // After patch the test should revert; before patch vault balance == 0, attacker gains full amount
}

```

### Mitigation

Replace the branch with correct netting logic:
```solidity 
else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    uint256 net = assetsToWithdraw - assetsToDeposit;  // safe‑math in 0.8
    assetsToWithdraw = net;
    assetsToDeposit  = 0;
}
```
Add an invariant after every commit:
`require(vault.previewRedeem(totalVaultShares) == totalAssets(), "share mismatch");`
