# Burve.sol stableswap pools incompatible with rebasing tokens, leading to LP loss

### Summary

Burve.sol is completely dependent on Uniswap v3 pools, which do not support rebasing tokens.

See Burve.sol, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L21-L23:
```solidity
/// @notice A stableswap AMM for a pair of tokens that uses multiple concentrated Uni-V3 positions
/// to replicate a super-set of stableswap math and other swap curves more efficiently than a numeric solution does.
contract Burve is ERC20 {
```

However, the contest README states rebasing tokens are supported.

### Root Cause

Uniswap v3 does not support rebasing tokens. No adjustment is made in the Burve code for rebasing tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

As stated in the Uniswap docs:

> Rebasing tokens will succeed in pool creation and swapping, but liquidity providers will bear the loss of a negative rebase when their position becomes active, with no way to recover the loss.

As this represents a permanent loss of funds to users, this is high severity.
