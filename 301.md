# The real token amounts earned by the bgt values is stuck in the `BGTExchanger` contract

### Summary

The real token amount sent to the `BGTExchanger` contract when `Closure::_trimBalance()` is called is stuck in the contract without a way to withdraw or utilize it leading to a loss of funds

### Root Cause


When `Closure::_trimBalance()` is called, a cal is made to all the vertices of the closure to account for the `reserveSharesEarned` and the `bgtResidual`.
- The `reserveSharesEarned` (aka `earnings`) is the amount of shares moved to the reserve for **non-bgt** values to claim later.
- The `bgtResidual` (aka `bgtReal`) is the real token amounts earned by the bgt values which can be exchanged.


```solidity
File: Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol
727:     function _trimBalance(
728:         Closure storage self,
729:         VertexId vid,
730:         uint256 nonBgtValueStaked
731:     ) private {
732:         uint8 idx = vid.idx();
733:         // Roundup the balance we need.
734:         uint256 realBalance = AdjustorLib.toReal(idx, self.balances[idx], true); 
735:  @>     (uint256 earnings, uint256 bgtReal) = Store.vertex(vid).trimBalance(
736:             self.cid,
737:             realBalance,
738:             self.valueStaked,
739:             self.bgtValueStaked
740:         );
741:         // All pools start with non-zero nonbgtvalue
742:         self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] += (earnings << 128) / nonBgtValueStaked; // earnings per non BGT value staked
743:         if (self.bgtValueStaked > 0) {
744:             (uint256 bgtEarned, uint256 unspent) = SimplexLib.bgtExchange(
745:                 idx,
746:    @>           bgtReal // The real token amounts earned by the bgt values which can be exchanged.
747:             );
748:             self.bgtPerBgtValueX128 += (bgtEarned << 128) / self.bgtValueStaked; // earnings per BGT value earned
749:             // rare
750:             if (unspent > 0) {
751:                 uint256 unspentShares = ReserveLib.deposit(vid, unspent);
752:                 self.unexchangedPerBgtValueX128[idx] += 
753:                     (unspentShares << 128) /
754:                     self.bgtValueStaked;
755:             }
756:         }
757:     }

```
the `bgtReal` is sent to the `BGTExchanger` contract to be exchanged for BGT using the `rate[inToken]` for the token under consideration as shown below.

```solidity
File: Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol
31:     function exchange(
32:         address inToken,
33:         uint128 amount
34:     ) external returns (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) {
35:         if (!isExchanger[msg.sender]) revert NoExchangePermissions();
36: 
37:         (bgtAmount, spendAmount) = viewExchange(inToken, amount);
38:         if (bgtAmount > 0) {
39:             bgtBalance -= bgtAmount; // 
40:      @>     TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom( // We take what we need.
41:                     inToken,
42:                     msg.sender,
43:                     address(this),
44:                     spendAmount
45:                 );
46:             owed[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
47:         }
48:     }


```

Meanwhile the exchanged BGT is made available using the `fund()` function shown below

```solidity
File: Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol
116:     function fund(uint256 amount) external {
117:         bgtBalance += amount;
118:    @>   TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
119:             bgtToken,
120:             msg.sender,
121:             address(this),
122:             amount
123:         );
124:     }

```

The problem is that there is no function to withdraw from this contract and as such the funds are stuck without a way to withdraw

### Internal Pre-conditions

`BGTExchange` contract is properly funded and `rate[inToken]` !=0

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

- for simplicity assume `rate[inToken]` = 1
- during triming, 1000 `bgtReal` is sent to the `BGTExchanger` contract in exchanges for 1000 BGT which can be withdrawn using the [`ValueFacet::CollectEarnings()` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L338)
- the `inToken` is transfered into the `BGTExchanger` but there is no function to access these funds by the admin hence they are stuck there leading to a loss of the `inToken` as they cannot be retrieved by even the admin

### Impact

Funds get stuck in `BGTExchanger` contract without a way to rescue them.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing a permissioned function to allow the funds to get resqued
