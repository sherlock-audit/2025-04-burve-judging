# Earned fees from tokens are lost upon withdrawal

### Summary

In the `SimplexFacet.withdraw()` function, although earned protocol fees are correctly tracked and reset, only the token balance held by the contract is transferred to the caller. As a result, earned fees are silently lost


### Root Cause

In [`SimplexFacet.sol:253-261`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol#L251-L261), the `withdraw()` function emits an event with the correct total amount (protocol balance + earned fees) but only transfers the protocol’s token balance — not including the recorded earned fees. 
```solidity
    function withdraw(address token) external {
        AdminLib.validateOwner();

        uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));

        if (TokenRegLib.isRegistered(token)) {
            uint8 idx = TokenRegLib.getIdx(token);
            uint256 earned = SimplexLib.protocolGive(idx);
            emit FeesWithdrawn(token, balance, earned);
        }

        if (balance > 0) {
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, balance);
        }

>>      // earned fees not handled
    }
```
This happens because the transferAmount is calculated but not used for the actual transfer; instead, only balance is transferred.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `SimplexLib.protocolEarnings[idx]` is non-zero for a registered token.
2. `TokenRegLib.isRegistered(token)` returns true for the token being withdrawn.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Contract owner calls SimplexFacet.withdraw(token).
2. The token has been earned as fees


### Attack Path

1. Protocol accumulates earnings in the form of an ERC20 token (e.g., via fees).
2. Admin initiates a withdraw() call.
3. The function emits an event showing the total earnings (correctly).
4. However, only the contract's token balance is transferred — not including separately tracked earnings.
5. The protocol's accounting (protocolEarnings) is reset to `zero`, but those tokens are never transferred.


### Impact

Earned fees are not transferred to the owner as intended, resulting in permanent fund loss.


### PoC
// Add the following test in `test/facets/SimplexFacet.t.sol`:
```solidity
    // Add this import to the existing ones
    import {console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

    function testWithdrawRegisteredTokenWithEarnedFeesLost() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);

        // simulate earned fees
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokens[0]);
        deal(address(token), diamond, 7e18);

        uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory protocolEarnings;
        protocolEarnings[0] = 7e18;
        storeManipulatorFacet.setProtocolEarnings(protocolEarnings);
        assertEq(protocolEarnings[0], 7e18);
        uint256 initialProtocolEarnings = protocolEarnings[0];
        console.log("Initial protocol earnings:", initialProtocolEarnings);

        // record balances
        uint256 initialOwnerBalance = token.balanceOf(owner);
        console.log("Initial owner balance:", initialOwnerBalance);
        uint256 initialProtocolBalance = token.balanceOf(diamond);
        assertGe(initialProtocolBalance, 7e18);
        console.log("Initial protocol balance:", initialProtocolBalance);

        // withdraw
        vm.expectEmit(true, false, false, true);
        emit SimplexFacet.FeesWithdrawn(address(token), 7e18, 7e18);
        simplexFacet.withdraw(address(token));

        // check balances
        uint256 finalOwnerBalance = token.balanceOf(owner);
        assertEq(finalOwnerBalance, initialOwnerBalance + initialProtocolBalance);
        uint256 finalProtocolBalance = token.balanceOf(diamond);
        assertEq(finalProtocolBalance, 0);
        console.log("Final protocol balance:", finalProtocolBalance);

        // check protocol earnings
        protocolEarnings = SimplexLib.protocolEarnings();
        assertEq(protocolEarnings[0], 0);
        console.log("Final protocol earnings:", protocolEarnings[0]);

        console.log("Final owner balance:", finalOwnerBalance);
        console.log("Fee lost:", initialProtocolEarnings + initialProtocolBalance - finalOwnerBalance);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
// Output
```solidity
[PASS] testWithdrawRegisteredTokenWithEarnedFeesLost() (gas: 310797)
Logs:
  Initial protocol earnings: 7000000000000000000
  Initial owner balance: 0
  Initial protocol balance: 7000000000000000000
  Final protocol balance: 0
  Final protocol earnings: 0
  Final owner balance: 7000000000000000000
  Fee lost: 7000000000000000000
```

### Mitigation
Include a mechanism to claim the rewards during the withdrawal
