# Users can reclaim their own fees through repeated deposits

### Summary  
The choice to distribute fees **instantly and linearly** without delay or time-based weighting allows users to reclaim part of their own fee by performing **repeated small deposits**. As a result, active users can optimize their returns at the expense of passive participants by leveraging fee distribution mechanics.

### Root Cause  
The decision to **distribute earnings immediately upon collection** in `addEarnings()`—**before** updating the user's asset balance—allows users to benefit from fees they just paid, using their **previous share** of the pool. This creates a soft exploit vector where users "recycle" their own fees with minimal cost.

[Asset.collect](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L134-L134)

### Internal Pre-conditions  

1. `addEarnings()` updates the closure’s earnings metrics **before** the user’s balance in `Asset` is increased.  
2. `collect()` runs before each deposit, assigning the user’s portion of newly added earnings based on their **previous share**.  
3. `assets.add()` updates the user’s stake **after** `collect()` is called.  

### External Pre-conditions  

1. There is **no delay or batching** in fee distribution — it's applied immediately.  
2. There are **no cooldowns, lockups, or epoch-based reward mechanisms**.  
3. Gas is cheap enough to perform **many small deposits**.  

### Attack Path  

1. Attacker deposits a small amount and gains a minimal share.  
2. Attacker performs another deposit, which triggers fee payment.  
3. The system distributes the paid fee across existing holders (including the attacker’s **previous share**).  
4. Before the attacker’s new deposit updates their share, `collect()` gives them back a portion of the fee they just paid.  
5. This cycle is repeated multiple times, compounding the attacker’s earnings.  

### Impact  
Passive LPs **earn significantly less** than expected, as strategic users recycle their own fees and dilute the pool.  
The attacker can **reclaim 20–50%** (or more) of their own fees, depending on the number of iterations.  
**This results in unfair distribution**, favoring active or automated actors over long-term stakers.

### Mitigation (optional)  

1. Implement **time-based fee weighting**, where rewards increase with holding duration.  
2. Use **delayed snapshotting** (e.g., Curve-style `checkpoint()` logic).  
3. Accumulate fees and distribute them **in batches**, not per deposit.  
4. Add a **cooldown or lockup** period before newly deposited value becomes eligible for rewards.
