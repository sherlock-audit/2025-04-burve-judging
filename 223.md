# Silent `uint256` to `uint128` truncation lets an attacker print “ghost” nominal-liquidity and dilute everyone else

### Summary

Within the [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226-L264) loop, the line

```solidity
uint128 liqInRange = uint128(
    shift96(uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true)
);
```
silently truncates the computed 256-bit value to 128 bits. An attacker can overflow this cast to mint an astronomically large number of Burve LP shares while only supplying the tiny wrapped‐around amount of underlying tokens

### Root Cause

Solidity 0.8 permits an explicit downcast from `uint256` to `uint128` without any overflow check. If the high 128 bits of `shiftedValue` are non‐zero, they’re silently dropped, so a huge `mintNominalLiq` produces a tiny `liqInRange` but grants the attacker proportionally huge LP‐shares.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

An attacker can call `mint(...)` with an arbitrarily large `mintNominalLiq`

### Attack Path

1. Attacker computes `mintNominalLiq` such that `shiftedValue = (uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i]) >> 96` exceed exceeds 2¹²⁸
2. Calls `mint(recipient = attacker, mintNominalLiq, …)`
3. In the Uniswap V3 mint callback, the protocol requests only `uint256 actualMint = uint128(shiftedValue)` which is the wrapped‐around (tiny) value—often just 1 wei.
4. Attacker sends this negligible amount, yet receives LP‐shares proportional to the original huge `mintNominalLiq`
5. Honest LPs are diluted to near zero share of the pool.

### Impact

- Attacker can steal >99% of protocol value
- Direct dilution of all other LPs’ holdings, converting them into “ghost” shares worth dust

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Tighten the cast by validating before downcast.

```solidity
- uint128 liqInRange = uint128(shiftedValue);
+ if (shiftedValue > type(uint128).max) {
+     revert LiquidityOverflow();
+ }
+ uint128 liqInRange = uint128(shiftedValue);

```


This ensures any overflow attempt reverts instead of silently truncating.
