# Representation of value token in ERC20 has issues

### Summary

The value token of multi-token pool is represented as ERC20, and users can mint tokens with their liquidity in any closure and then burn them in any other closure at their will.

This implementation has issues because users who minted value tokens with a specific closure might not burn their tokens in the same closure later.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is in [`VaultTokenFacet`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueTokenFacet.sol#L16-L32) contract where `mint` and `burn` functions can be called with any closure.

### Attack Path

**Scenario for 1st impact provided**

- Alice deposits 100 value tokens into `Closure1` and mints 100 value tokens from her liquidity.
- Bob deposits 100 value tokens into `Closure2` and mints 100 value tokens from his liquidity.
- Bob burns his 100 value tokens in `Closure1` and gets 100 value worth of liquidity in `Closure1`.
- Later, when Alice tries to burn her 100 value tokens in `Closure1`, but she fails because the `Closure1` has already filled liquidity.

**Scenario for 2nd impact provided**

- As there can be 16 tokens in the pool, there can be upto 2^16 closures.
- Let's say the value tokens are actively used from those wide pools, for example, 1000 value tokens each from 1000 closures.
- Now, Bob repeatedly mints 1000 value tokens from a closure he wants to make unusable and burns them in other closures.
- At the end, other closures become filled but the closure made unusable by Bob remains lack of liquidity.

### Impact

There can be multiple impacts related to this issue.

1. Users lose their ability to burn their value tokens in the closure they minted them.
2. A malicious user can make a closure unusable by repeatedly minting tokens from the closure and burning them in other closures.

        vm.expectRevert();
        valueTokenFacet.burn(100e18, 0, 0x03);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Instead of ERC20, ERC1155 has to be used to represent the value token in specific closure.
