# Potential Integer Overflow in Liquidity Calculations

### Summary

**Finding Description and Impact**:
The contract uses fixed-point arithmetic for liquidity calculations, which can lead to integer overflow in certain edge cases. While Solidity 0.8.x includes built-in overflow protection, the contract might be using custom bit manipulation that bypasses these checks.

The `X96_MASK` constant is defined as `(1 << 96) - 1`, which is used for bitwise operations. If calculations involving this mask and large token amounts are performed incorrectly, it could lead to incorrect liquidity calculations and potentially loss of funds.


### Root Cause

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The root cause is the potential for integer overflow in fixed-point arithmetic operations used for liquidity calculations.

**Vulnerable Code Location**:
- File: `src/single/Burve.sol`
- Constants: `X96_MASK`, `UNIT_NOMINAL_LIQ_X64`
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L24

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

**Exploitation Scenario**:
1. A user deposits an extremely large amount of tokens
2. The liquidity calculation overflows, resulting in incorrect shares being minted
3. The user can then burn these shares to withdraw more tokens than they deposited

### Impact

incorrect liquidity calculations and potentially loss of funds

### PoC

**Proof of Concept**:
The contract defines fixed-point arithmetic constants:
```solidity
uint256 private constant X96_MASK = (1 << 96) - 1;
uint256 private constant UNIT_NOMINAL_LIQ_X64 = 1 << 64;
```

These constants are likely used in liquidity calculations, which could overflow if not handled properly.

### Mitigation

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**:
1. Ensure all arithmetic operations that could potentially overflow are properly checked
2. Consider using OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library for operations that bypass Solidity 0.8.x's built-in overflow checks
3. Add upper bounds to token deposit amounts to prevent extreme values
