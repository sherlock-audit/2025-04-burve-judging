# Incorrect implementation of `ERC4626ViewAdjustor`

### Summary

Adjustor contracts have 2 main functions which are `toNominal` and `toReal`, which convert between real and nominal values of a token.

`ERC4626ViewAdjustor` is an implementation for LSTs such as `stETH`.
However, the implementation of `toNominal` and `toReal` is incorrect within this contract. Here's code snippets:

```solidity
    function toNominal(
        address token,
        uint256 real,
        bool
    ) external view returns (uint256 nominal) {
        IERC4626 vault = getVault(token);
        return vault.convertToShares(real);
    }

    function toReal(
        address token,
        uint256 nominal,
        bool
    ) external view returns (uint256 real) {
        IERC4626 vault = getVault(token);
        return vault.convertToAssets(nominal);
    }
```

The goal of `toNominal` is to convert a real value to a nominal value, such as converting `stETH` balance in `ETH`.
In vice versa, `toReal` is to convert a nominal value to a real value, such as converting `ETH` to `stETH`.

But as shown in the code snippets above, the implementation of `toNominal` and `toReal` is reversed, as `toNominal` is using `convertToShares` and `toReal` is using `convertToAssets`.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is in [`ERC4626ViewAdjustor`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/E4626ViewAdjustor.sol#L29-L71) contract where the implementation of `toNominal` and `toReal` is reversed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

One of LSTs is used in multi-token pool with `ERC4626ViewAdjustor` as the adjustor.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- Assume, `stETH` and `WETH` are used in the pool, and `1 stETH = 1.1 WETH`.
- Alice adds 100 value worth of tokens to the pool, which eventually will require 100 `WETH` and 100 `WETH` worth of `stETH`.
- However, as `toReal` function which is used to calculate the amount of `stETH` uses `convertToAssets`, the amount of `stETH` to deposit becomes `110 stETH` instead of `100/1.1 stETH`.

### Impact

Loss of funds for users as they deposit more than they should.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The fix is to reverse the implementation of `toNominal` and `toReal` in `ERC4626ViewAdjustor` contract.
