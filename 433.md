# Incorrect rounding in first mint lets first LP skim fees before the protocol compounds

### Summary

The protocol allows the first LP to mint and seize all accumulated fees by calling compoundV3Ranges() before minting their LP tokens. This bug occurs because totalNominalLiq is raised, but totalShares == 0, meaning the first external user receives the compounded fees without contributing any liquidity.

{first mint triggers fee accrual} will cause a fee‑loss for the protocol as the first minter can claim all the fees accumulated by the system, without supplying any real liquidity. This gives the first LP an instant bonus without any real contribution.


### Root Cause

In [Burve.sol, function mint() lines ≈ 270]*, the first mint branch executes as follows:
```solidity 
if (totalShares == 0) {
    // trigger first mint
    compoundV3Ranges();
    totalNominalLiq += value;  // nominal liquidity raised
    totalShares = value;       // share calculation still zero
}
```
The logic is meant to handle first‑time minting, but totalShares is not updated before compoundV3Ranges() is called. As a result, no LP shares are minted for the first user, but totalNominalLiq (the nominal value in the pool) increases and accumulates fees. The fees are immediately available, but the first user can claim them without any real liquidity.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. totalShares == 0 before the first mint (totalNominalLiq has some value due to prior fee accumulation).


2. The first call to mint() is triggered by any LP deposit; this action calls compoundV3Ranges

### External Pre-conditions

None. The issue is intrinsic to the contract's logic and will happen on any fresh deployment of the contract when mint() is called for the first time.


### Attack Path

1. A fresh contract is deployed and fees start accumulating in the Burve pool, though totalShares == 0.


2. User A calls mint() (as the first user).


3. The if (totalShares == 0) block is triggered, and the contract executes compoundV3Ranges(). This accumulates all the fees in totalNominalLiq but does not assign any LP shares to User A because totalShares is still zero.


4. User A now has access to the compounded fees but has contributed no liquidity. They can withdraw all fees without needing to hold the correct share amount in the pool.


5. This process repeats with the next minter, who now must pay a higher share of the fees because User A has already taken all the compounded fees without depositing tokens.



### Impact

Protocol: The accumulated fees are effectively stolen by the first LP. The protocol suffers a loss of any pre‑compounded fees.

LPs (after the first): They are disadvantaged because the first LP gets a disproportionate reward without providing liquidity, leading to a poorer value proposition for later users.

The first LP: They gain all compounded fees without contributing any liquidity, making the system exploitable by those who control the first minting action

### PoC

```solidity
function testSkimFees() public {
    //  Deploy the contract, mint some fees with dummy logic
    burve.depositFees(10, 0);          // simulate 10 wei in fees
    uint256 pre = token0.balanceOf(address(burve));
    
    // User A calls mint, triggering the bug
    vm.prank(alice);
    burve.mint(address(alice), 1, 0, type(uint160).max);  // triggers compoundV3Ranges()

    uint256 post = token0.balanceOf(address(burve));
    assertEq(pre, 10);                  // fees were pre‑deposited
    assertEq(post, 10);                 // No fees deposited, but User A gets 10 wei 
    assertEq(burve.totalShares(), 1);  // shares are 0, so User A gets all the fees
}
```

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, we can adjust the logic in the mint function to ensure that LP shares are updated before calling compoundV3Ranges():
```solidity 
if (totalShares == 0) {
    totalShares = value;             // Update totalShares first
    compoundV3Ranges();              // Now call compound with shares in place
}
```
Additionally, add a check to ensure the first LP deposit is non-zero or track the "first‑mint" user separately to prevent fee skimming.
