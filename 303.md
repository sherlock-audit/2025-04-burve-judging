# Users can't remove single value if a vertice is on lock

### Summary

To add value the user must call [`addValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L58) or [`addValueSingle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L100C14-L100C28) or [`addSingleForValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L139C14-L139C31); inside each of these call, the vertex [`deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L93) function is called for each vertice ID.
For each deposit call for a certain vertice a check is in place to make sure value can't be added to a locked vertice [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L114);
```solidity
    /// Closures deposit a real amount into this Vertex.
    function deposit(
        Vertex storage self,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
>       require(!self._isLocked, VertexLocked(self.vid));
        VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
        vProxy.deposit(cid, amount);
        vProxy.commit();
    }

```
But when removing value using either of the three removal methods, the vertex [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L207) function is called; this function has an extra bool argument [`checklock`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L125) that needs to be true and a vertix to locked to block user from removing value.
```solidity
 function withdraw(
        Vertex storage self,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount,
        bool checkLock
    ) internal {
  >      require(!(checkLock && self._isLocked), VertexLocked(self.vid));  // if checklock = true and self.isLocked = true  
        VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);             // checkLock && self._isLocked == true 
        vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);                                         // !(checkLock && self._isLocked) == false     // and the call reverts 
        vProxy.commit();
    }
```
But when we look at this withdraw function called in either of the three removal methods the `checkLock` is always false [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L207) and [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L234) and also [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L274), this means that even is the vertice(token) is locked the require in the withdraw function will always be satisfied and the function wouln't revert.
In addition there is this [comment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L206) that says users can remove value even is the token is locked; and also sponsor confirmed that is a private thread. 
However, in all removal cases, checkLock is hardcoded as false, meaning the lock check is effectively disabled — value can always be removed, even if the vertex is locked.

Now we gonna talk about the issue that exists when calling [removeValueSingle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214) and [removeSingleForValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L248C14-L248C34), inside each of these function calls, in the closure library the appropriate function is called to remove value; but the problem is that there is a check that will cause the function to revert if a vertix is locked for [`removeValueSingle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L252) and for  [`removeSingleForValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L343)

### Root Cause

`Vertex.withdraw` allows removal by skipping lock check (checkLock = false)

`ClosureImpl.removeValueSingle` and `ClosureImpl.removeSingleForValue` enforce lock check via:
```solidity
 require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
```


### Impact

This violates the intended behavior as users are blocked from removing value using two of the three removal methods if any involved vertex is locked

### Mitigation

Alternatively, standardize behavior: if locked vertices should block removal, enable checkLock = true in `Vertex.withdraw`. But since the intent is to allow removal even when locked, the best fix is to remove the extra check.
```diff
- require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
```
