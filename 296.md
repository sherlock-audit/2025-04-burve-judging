# `mintIsland()` approves `amount0/amount1` instead of `mint0/mint1`

### Summary

Proving `amount0` and `amount1` (the **maximum** tokens that *could* be needed) instead of the smaller `mint0` and `mint1` (the **exact** tokens that **will** be needed) exposes the contract balance to unnecessary risk if the Island contract is upgraded / compromised.

Over-approval of ERC-20 allowances will allow an unexpected token drain for the protocol, as a malicious Island implementation can transfer arbitrary extra funds.

### Root Cause

[`mintIsland()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L296) (context snippet) the allowances are set with the variables returned from `getAmountsForLiquidity()` instead of `getMintAmounts()`:

```solidity
// WRONG – uses amount0/amount1
SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(island), amount0);
SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(island), amount1);
```

Yet only `mint0` and `mint1` are transferred into the contract just beforehand:

```solidity
TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(address(token0), msg.sender, address(this), mint0);
TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(address(token1), msg.sender, address(this), mint1);
```

Because `mint0 ≤ amount0` and `mint1 ≤ amount1`, the contract grants a larger allowance than its actual balance.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. Island implementation becomes malicious and calls `transferFrom()` for the full allowance.

### Attack Path

. Malicious Island contract detects the over-approval.  
2. Calls `transferFrom(minterContract, maliciousAddr, amount0-mint0)` for `token0` (same for `token1`) during `mint()`
3. Tokens that were never intended to leave the contract are drained.

### Impact

Protocol-owned idle balances of `token0` and `token1` inside the contract can be stolen.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Approve only what will actually be pulled:

```solidity
SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(island), mint0);
SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(island), mint1);
```
