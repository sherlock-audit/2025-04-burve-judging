# `swapOut` overcharges the fee relative to `swapIn`

### Summary

In the `SwapFacet::swap` function, the logic determines whether to call `Closure::swapInExact` or `Closure::swapOutExact` based on the `amountSpecified` direction.

The function converts the asset amount to nominal terms using 18 decimals. For instance, when using WBTC (8 decimals), a value of `1e8` is scaled by `1e10` to match the 18-decimal standard (`1e8 * 1e10 = 1e18`).

Within `swapInExact`, the fee is [[calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L398)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L398) using:

```solidity
FullMath.mulX128(inAmount, self.baseFeeX128, true);
```

In contrast, `swapOutExact` [[calculates the fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L489-L493)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L489-L493) as:

```solidity
UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp(untaxedInAmount << 128, ONEX128 - self.baseFeeX128);
```

Assuming a scenario with 1 BTC (\$96,925.95) and a fee of 0.01%:

* `swapInExact`: `FullMath.mulX128(inAmount, self.baseFeeX128, true)` yields 0.01e18, equating to \~\$969.26
* `swapOutExact`: The calculated fee results in \~0.01010101010101010101e18 or \~\$979.05

This implies that for 1 BTC of volume, the discrepancy in fee charged is approximately \$10.

### Root Cause

The fee calculation in `swapOutExact` differs from `swapInExact`, leading to a higher effective fee for `exactOut` swaps.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. None

### External Pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

1. None

### Impact

Users performing `exactOut` swaps are overcharged in fees relative to those using `exactIn`, potentially discouraging use or leading to user dissatisfaction.

### PoC

*No response*

### Mitigation

Standardize the fee calculation logic across both `swapInExact` and `swapOutExact` to ensure consistent fee outcomes.
