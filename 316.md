# H[01]-Incorrect variable used in mulDiv calculation â€” realTax is always zero


## Summary
In `removeValueSingle`, the computation of realTax uses an uninitialized variable `removedBalance`instead of `realRemoved`. As a result, the multiplication always results in zero.

## Lines of Code affected
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214-L244

## Vulnerability Details
within this snippet:
```solidity
uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);

Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);

uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
    removedBalance, // @audit should be realRemoved
    nominalTax,
    removedNominal
);

```

removedBalance has not been assigned yet and defaults to 0. Thus, realTax is always computed as 0, regardless of actual tax owed.

This leads to underpayment of tax and incorrect earnings accounting via `c.addEarnings`.



## Impact

- `realTax` is always zero, even when tax is due.
- The protocol fails to collect intended earnings.


## Recommendation 
Use the correct variable (`realRemoved`) in the tax computation, so the fixed code becomes:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
    - removedBalance,
    + realRemoved,
    nominalTax,
    removedNominal
);
```
