# Withdrawal Miscalculation Causes Permanent Funds Lock in Vault with Fees

# Withdrawal Miscalculation Causes Permanent Funds Lock in Vault with Fees

### Summary

When withdrawing from an underlying ERC4626 vault that charges a withdrawal fee, the system incorrectly assumes that the requested withdrawal `amount` equals the **net assets received**, rather than accounting for the fact that the vault requires a larger input to deliver the desired post-fee amount. This results in part of the funds being permanently locked in the vault, especially as the fee compounds over multiple operations.


### Root Cause

In the `fetch` function, the system computes:

```solidity
function fetch(
    VaultE4626 storage self,
    VaultTemp memory temp  
) internal view {
    temp.vars[0] = self.vault.previewRedeem(self.totalVaultShares);           
    temp.vars[3] = self.vault.previewRedeem(
        self.vault.previewDeposit(1 << 128)
    );                                                                        
}
```

In this function, `temp.vars[0]` stores the result of calling `previewRedeem(self.totalVaultShares)`, which estimates the total amount of underlying assets that could be redeemed if all the vault’s current shares were withdrawn — effectively capturing the vault’s total net assets after accounting for withdrawal fees. On the other hand, `temp.vars[3]` computes the discount factor by first simulating a standardized deposit (`previewDeposit(1 << 128)`) to determine how many shares that amount would mint, and then estimating how many assets those shares would redeem via `previewRedeem`.

However,the system fails to properly differentiate between **pre-fee** and **post-fee** amounts when interacting with ERC4626 vaults that charge withdrawal fees. Specifically, when the system calculates how many shares to withdraw to meet a desired token amount, it incorrectly assumes that withdrawing `amount` shares will yield the same `amount` in net assets. However, ERC4626 vaults apply withdrawal fees, meaning the system needs to withdraw a larger **gross** amount to achieve the desired **net** amount. This misalignment leads to a cumulative mismatch where part of the funds becomes permanently locked inside the vault, as the system consistently underestimates how much should be withdrawn relative to what can actually be retrieved after fees.


### Attack Path

Assume the underlying vault starts with:

```solidity
totalShares = 200
totalAssets = 200(before withdraw)
```

and has : Withdraw fee: 50%

The E4626 owns all underlying vault shares,Closure A owns all totalShares.

```solidity
totalVaultShares = 200
totalAssets = 200 * 0.5 = 100

temp.vars[0] = self.vault.previewRedeem(self.totalVaultShares) = 100
temp.vars[3] = self.vault.previewRedeem(self.vault.previewDeposit(1 << 128)) = 0.5 * X128

totalShares = 100
shares[A] = 100
```


Then, closure B deposits 200 tokens

```Solidity
    function deposit( 
        VaultE4626 storage self,
        VaultTemp memory temp, 
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        uint256 newlyAdding = FullMath.mulX128(
            temp.vars[1],  
            temp.vars[3],  
            true // Round up to round shares down.
        );
        uint256 totalAssets = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding - temp.vars[2]; 
        uint256 discountedAmount = FullMath.mulX128(
            amount,
            temp.vars[3],
            false // Round down to round shares down.
        );
        uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
            ? discountedAmount
            : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);  

        self.shares[cid] += newShares;
        self.totalShares += newShares;  
        temp.vars[1] += amount;  
    }
```

```Solidity
shares[B] = 200 * temp.vars[3] * totalShares  / temp.vars[0] = 200 * 0.5 * 100 / 100 = 100
totalShares = 100 + 100 = 200
temp.vars[1] = amount = 200
```

update E4626

```Solidity
totalShares = 200
shares[A] = 100
shares[B] = 100
```


commit:

```Solidity
    function commit(VaultE4626 storage self, VaultTemp memory temp) internal {
        uint256 assetsToDeposit = temp.vars[1];
        uint256 assetsToWithdraw = temp.vars[2];
...
        if (assetsToDeposit > 0) {
            // Temporary approve the deposit.
            SafeERC20.forceApprove(
                self.token,
                address(self.vault), 
                assetsToDeposit
            );
            self.totalVaultShares += self.vault.deposit(  
                assetsToDeposit,
                address(this)  
            );
            SafeERC20.forceApprove(self.token, address(self.vault), 0);
```

```Solidity
assetsToDeposit = temp.vars[1] = 200
totalVaultShares += self.vault.deposit(200) = 200 + 200 * 200 / 200 = 200 + 200 = 400
```

update E4626

```Solidity
totalVaultShares = 400
```


Now, if closure B wants to withdraw **all** its shares:

```Solidity
    function withdraw(
        VaultE4626 storage self,
        VaultTemp memory temp,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        uint256 newlyAdding = FullMath.mulX128(
            temp.vars[1],
            temp.vars[3],
            false // Round down to round shares removed up.
        );
        uint256 totalAssets = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding - temp.vars[2];
        uint256 sharesToRemove = FullMath.mulDiv(
            self.totalShares,
            amount,
            totalAssets
        ); // Rounds down, leaves some share dust in the vault.
        self.shares[cid] -= sharesToRemove;
        self.totalShares -= sharesToRemove;
        temp.vars[2] += amount; 
    }
```

withdraw(100)

```solidity
amount = 100
totalshares = 200
totalAssets = 400 * 0.5 = 200

sharesToRemove = 100 * 200 / 200 = 100

shares[B] = 100 - 100 = 0

temp.vars[2] = 100
```

then commit,withdraw(temp.vars[2])

```Solidity
vault.withdraw(100) = 50
```

In theory, vault B owns **half** of the vault, so even after a 50% withdrawal fee, it should be able to get:

```Solidity
400 * 0.5 * 0.5 = 100
```

However, in practice, if they want to withdraw 100, they need to set:

```Solidity
amount = 200
```

However, `shares[B]` calculation will revert now, because the underlying vault expects **pre-fee** amounts to be passed in.

This mismatch causes a permanent lock on part of the funds:
Whenever the vault has a withdrawal fee, part of the liquidity can **never** be fully extracted, as the system incorrectly under-calculates the amount that needs to be passed into the vault.

For example, with a 1% withdrawal fee, **1% of the total funds will remain forever stuck**.

### Impact

The system progressively locks user capital in the underlying vault, especially in high-fee environments. Over time, this reduces the extractable liquidity, breaks economic assumptions, and causes user funds to become inaccessible. 


### Mitigation

When performing a withdrawal, always calculate the **pre-fee** amount needed to achieve the desired **post-fee** assets, using the vault’s `previewWithdraw()` or similar helper functions. For example, to receive 50 tokens, the system should call `vault.withdraw(100)` (if there’s a 50% fee), not `vault.withdraw(50)`.
