# Double-Counting of Fees in `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle`

### Summary

The `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle` function incorrectly calculates the final amount of tokens transferred to the user when removing value from a closure via a single token type. The core issue lies in subtracting the calculated fee (`realTax`) from an amount (`realRemoved`) that has already been calculated net-of-fees by the underlying `Closure.removeValueSingle` function. This results in the fee being applied twice, once implicitly by the `Closure` logic and once explicitly in the `ValueFacet`.

// NOTE: There is Typo bug here which I reported (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve-vaib25vicky/issues/1),  should use `realRemoved`, not `removedBalance`. Assume fixed for analysis.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214
The core issue stems from these lines within `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle`: 

```solidity
        // ... preceding code ...
        (uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(
            value,
            bgtValue,
            vid
        );
        // 'removedNominal' is net amount. 'nominalTax' is the fee amount.

        // Convert net nominal amount to real token equivalent.
        // 'realRemoved' now holds the correct net amount the user SHOULD receive.
        uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);

        // Withdraw the NET amount from the vault (potential separate issue: maybe should withdraw net+tax?).
        Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);

        // Calculate the real token equivalent of the fee.
        // NOTE: Typo here, should use realRemoved, not removedBalance. Assume fixed for analysis.
        uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            realRemoved, // Corrected from removedBalance for analysis
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );

        // Credit earnings (correct)
        c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);

        // **** ROOT CAUSE ****
        // Subtract the fee ('realTax') from the already net amount ('realRemoved').
        removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax; // Fee applied second time.

        // Check slippage against the doubly-reduced amount.
        require(removedBalance >= minReceive, PastSlippageBounds());

        // Transfer the doubly-reduced amount to the user.
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, removedBalance);
```

Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#removeValueSingle

```solidity
    function removeValueSingle(
        // ... parameters ...
    ) internal returns (uint256 removedAmount, uint256 tax) {
        // ... require statements, trimAllBalances, scale calculations ...

        uint256 fairVBalance = iterSingleValueDiff(self, valIter, false);

        uint256 finalAmount = ValueLib.x(
            self.targetX128,
            veX128, // Efficiency factor for the vertex
            currentValueX128 - valIter.valueSumX128, // Target value after removing the difference
            true
        );

       
        uint256 untaxedRemove = fairVBalance - finalAmount;

        // Update the balance to the calculated finalAmount
        self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);

        // **** Tax Calculation ****
        // Apply the closure's base fee to the 'untaxedRemove' amount
        tax = FullMath.mulX128(untaxedRemove, self.baseFeeX128, true);

        // Calculate the final net amount to return to the facet
        // Note: Initial 'removedAmount' was calculated earlier as self.balances[valIter.vIdx] - fairVBalance
        // This line adds the 'untaxedRemove' amount (net of the calculated tax) back to the initial removed amount.
        // Therefore, the final value of removedAmount that gets returned by the Closure.removeValueSingle function 
        // has already had the fee (tax) accounted for and subtracted.
        removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax;

        // ... update valueStaked ...
    }
```

### Attack Path

Let's assume:
*   `AdjustorLib.toReal` provides a 1:1 conversion (nominal = real) for simplicity.
*   The `closure` has a `baseFeeX128` equivalent to a 5% fee.
*   A user calls `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle` to withdraw `value` corresponding to 100 nominal tokens *before fees*.

*   **Inside `Closure.removeValueSingle`:**
    *   The function calculates the fee. 5% of 100 is 5.
    *   It determines the *net nominal amount* the user should receive: 100 - 5 = 95 nominal tokens.
    *   It returns `removedNominal` = 95 and `nominalTax` = 5.

*   **Inside `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle`:**
    1.  `removedNominal` = 95 (from Closure call)
    2.  `nominalTax` = 5 (from Closure call)
    3.  `realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal[95], false)` -> `realRemoved` = 95. *(This is the correct net amount the user should get).*
    4.  `Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved[95], false)`: 95 tokens are withdrawn from the vault balance associated with this closure.
    5.  `realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved[95], nominalTax[5], removedNominal[95])` -> `realTax` = 5. *(Correctly calculates the real fee amount).*
    6.  `c.addEarnings(vid, realTax[5])`: Protocol earnings are credited with 5 tokens.
    7.  **Incorrect Step:** `removedBalance = realRemoved[95] - realTax[5]` -> `removedBalance` = 90. *(The fee (5) is subtracted from the already net amount (95)).*
    8.  `TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, removedBalance[90])`: The user receives 90 tokens.

### Impact

Users withdrawing value via `removeValueSingle` receive fewer tokens than they are entitled to according to the protocol's fee structure.
