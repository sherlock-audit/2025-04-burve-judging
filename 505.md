# There is no rebalance mechanism in single pool and collected fees could be locked

## Summary
There is no rebalance mechanism in single pool and as result the collected fees could be locked in the pool.

## Root Cause

In single pool, [`compoundV3Ranges()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L739-L815) collect fees from ranges and compound them for each V3 ranges. The ranges of the pool is immutable after initialized.

The amount of token0 and token1 which are going to be added in each range varies on current price. In case of price is out of range, then, only one token will be needed for adding liquidiy. If the price is in the range, it will require both token0 and token1.

Therefore, there could be remaining collected fees in the pool after distributing among ranges. Of course, these unallocated fees are distributed in the ranges next invoke of function, but in worst case they won't be distributed and will be locked in the pool. 

## Internal pre-conditions


## External pre-conditions


## Attack Path
Let' consider following scenario.
1. There is burve single pool ETH/USDC, which has ranges [1600, 1800], [1600, 2000]. (we will consider only 2 ranges for convenience)
2. Users add liquidity in the pool and fee will be collected, then distributed to pools.
3. When current price approahces to $2000, only USDC will be used for adding liquidity. If the price is higher than 2000, collected ETH won't be used for adding liquidity.
4. If the price doesn't decrease ETH will be locked in the pool, since it will not be used for liquidity.

## Impact
The collected fees will be locked in the pool.

## Mitigation

Implement rebalance mechanism to the pool, so that distributes all collected fees to ranges without any remainings.
