# [M-1] The Protocol Lacks a way to `claimRewards()` which can result in loss of rewards from external vaults

### Summary

All the deposits and withdrawals in the Vaults by the protocol are done by the `SimplexDiamond` as owner, these vaults are `ERC4626`  vaults and yield generated is directly added to the deposits but some `ERC4626` vaults have their own reward mechanisms and these can be claimed by the vault owner , However the protocol lacks the function to claim these rewards resulting in loss of these rewards for the depositors

This is the `claimRewards` function in commonly used ERC4626 vault like [AAVE](https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/incentives#write-methods-claimrewards) which states

`Claims reward for a user to the desired address, on all the assets of the pool, accumulating the pending rewards. Rewards are received by the  to  address.`

### Root Cause

RootCause : [RootCause](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L344-L351)

Consider the snippet from `ValueFacet::collectEarnings`:

```solidity

 function collectEarnings(address recipient, uint16 closureId)
        external
        returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory collectedBalances, uint256 collectedBgt)
    {

        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(closureId);
        // Catch up on rehypothecation gains before we claim fees.
        Store.closure(cid).trimAllBalances();
        uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory collectedShares;
        (collectedShares, collectedBgt) = Store.assets().claimFees(msg.sender, cid);       

        if (collectedBgt > 0) {
            IBGTExchanger(Store.simplex().bgtEx).withdraw(recipient, collectedBgt);
        }
        TokenRegistry storage tokenReg = Store.tokenRegistry();
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
            if (collectedShares[i] > 0) {
                VertexId vid = VertexLib.newId(i);
                // Real amounts.
@>                collectedBalances[i] = ReserveLib.withdraw(vid, collectedShares[i]);       //No claim Rewards
                TransferHelper.safeTransfer(tokenReg.tokens[i], recipient, collectedBalances[i]);
            }
        }
      
    }
```


The Earnings and yield generated is collected by a depositor by calling `ValueFacet::collectEarnings` but the function itself doesn't implement a way to `claimRewards` resulting in loss of all those rewards for the depositors 

### Internal Pre-conditions

The integrated Vault should have a reward mechanism which allows depositors to claim those rewards


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User Deposits
2. Rewards get Accrued in the External Vault
3. User Collects Earnings but doesn't get the Rewards as there is no function to claim them

### Impact

If the vault used has accrued rewards then there is no way to claim them resulting in loss of all those rewards

### PoC


1. Import Console,SimplexFacet,MockERC4626,IERC4626 in `VaultFacet.t.sol`
   
   ```solidity
    import {console} from "forge-std/console.sol";
    import {SimplexFacet} from "../../src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol";
    import {IERC4626} from "openzeppelin-contracts/interfaces/IERC4626.sol";
    import {MockERC4626} from "../mocks/MockERC4626.sol";
   ```

2. Modify `MockERC4626` as shown below :

```solidity
        
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import "openzeppelin-contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract MockERC4626 is ERC4626 {
    constructor(ERC20 asset, string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) ERC4626(asset) {}

    mapping(address => uint256) public rewards;

    function setRewards(address _user, uint256 _rewards) external {
        rewards[_user] = _rewards;
    }

    function getRewards(address _user) external view returns (uint256) {
        return rewards[_user];
    }

    function claimRewards(address to, uint256 depositorShare) external {
        //
        // This is a Mock Claim Rewards Function
        //
        uint256 amount = rewards[msg.sender];
        require(amount - depositorShare > 0, "No rewards to claim");
        rewards[msg.sender] -= depositorShare;
        _mint(to, depositorShare);
    }

    //
}
    

```

Poc : Run the following command in the terminal `forge test --mt test_NoClaimRewards -vv`

<summary>test_NoClaimRewards</summary>

```solidity
    function test_NoClaimRewards() public {
        // When fees exist, we lose value so we can't remove the same amount anymore.

        address _token = address(tokens[2]);
        deal(_token, address(this), 1e19);

        uint256 _bgtExperiment = 1 << 256 - 1;
        uint256 oneX128 = 1 << 128;
        vm.prank(owner);
        simplexFacet.setClosureFees(0xD, uint128(oneX128 / 10000), uint128(oneX128 / 10000)); // One basis point. Realistic.

        address _griefer = makeAddr("griefer");

        deal(tokens[2], address(_griefer), 4e20);

        uint128 _amountG = 1e19;
        vm.startPrank(_griefer);
        ERC20(tokens[2]).approve(address(valueFacet), _amountG);
        uint256 _valueReceived = valueFacet.addSingleForValue(address(_griefer), 0xD, tokens[2], _amountG, 0, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256 valueReceived = valueFacet.addSingleForValue(address(this), 0xD, tokens[2], 1e19, 0, 0);

        //At this point we simutate Rewards added to the Vault which can be claimed by the owner i.e simplexDiamond
        //we consider at this point that a lot of time has passed and 1e18 tokens of rewards have been added

        uint256 _rewards = 1e18;
        address simplexDiamond = address(0x9B5491D1899dB14bfA4Bb1D91d24f007943bEd1D);

        MockERC4626 externalVault = MockERC4626(address(vaults[2]));
        externalVault.setRewards(simplexDiamond, _rewards);

        //Owner withdraws protocol Take
        vm.prank(owner);
        simplexFacet.withdraw(address(tokens[2]));

        //User Collects Earnings
        address _Random = makeAddr("Random");
        vm.prank(address(_griefer));
        valueFacet.collectEarnings(address(_Random), 0xD);

        //Rewards were never Claimed
        console.log("Rewards remaining in Vault: ", externalVault.getRewards(simplexDiamond));
        assertEq(externalVault.getRewards(simplexDiamond), _rewards);
    }
```

### Mitigation

Theres an enum named `VaultType` in `VaultPointer.sol` ,consider adding a new type of vailt to it i.e`claim_Vault` and this calls `claimRewards` function during `collectEarnings` if the current vault or Backup vault type is `claim_Vault` , also implement this during vault migrations and fund transfers from one vault to other
