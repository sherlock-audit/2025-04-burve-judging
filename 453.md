# `Burve` lacks a mechanic to generate protocol earnings from single pools

### Summary

The `Burve` protocol offers a stableswap AMM for a pair of tokens that uses multiple concentrated Uni-V3 positions. In it, users can provide stablecoin liquidity to a predefined UniswapV3 pool. Users will benefit from the fees generated by UniswapV3 and Kodiak. The protocol, however, does not have a clear way to generate any income out of this, as when fees are compounded, they are fully reinvested, without taking a share for the `Burve` protocol, meaning that the protocol does not generate any income from single pools.

### Root Cause

The `Burve` protocol has not implemented any mechanism to generate income from users minting and burning the `Burve` token.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users start minting and burning using `Burve.sol`
2. UniswapV3 fees are [compounded](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L739).

### Mitigation

Whenever UniswapV3 fees are collected, take a percentage of them as protocol earnings, like other protocols do.
