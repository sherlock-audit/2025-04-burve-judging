# There is a problem with the internal call order of removeValue/removeValueSingle, which will cause liquidity providers to lose their profits.

### Summary

In the ValueFacet.sol contract, the removeValue/removeValueSingle functions both call the Store.assets().remove() function then the c.removeValue()/c.removeValueSingle() function. In Store.assets().remove() function, it will first settle the user's earnings then remove the user's liquidity value.

Store.assets().remove():
```solidity
        collect(self, owner, cid);
···
        unchecked {
            a.value -= value;
            a.bgtValue -= bgtValue;
        }
```
collect():
```soldity
            a.collectedBalances[i] +=
                FullMath.mulX128(
                    (epvX128[i] - a.earningsPerValueX128Check[i]),
                    nonBgtValue,
                    false
```
Among them, the focus of update returns is on the epvX128[i] variable, which represents the amount of returns that each value should receive. When the income is updated at this time, this variable has not been updated yet and there is no income from the settlement vault.
The proceeds of the settlement vault are settled in the next c.removeValue() function through `trimAllBalances(self)`.
```solidity
    function _trimBalance(
···
        self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] += (earnings << 128) / nonBgtValueStaked;
```
Therefore, when a user removes liquidity via the removeValue/removeValueSingle function, the user return is settled before the total return of the vault is calculated. As a result, users are missing part of the revenue.

This is a lack of duplication, and the specific amount of loss depends on the call time of adding/removing liquidity, and there is a possibility that the user will lose more than 1%.

### Root Cause

In the [ValueFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L190-L191) contract, the removeValue/removeValueSingle functions both call the Store.assets().remove() function before calling the c.removeValue()/c.removeValueSingle() function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The longer the interval between adding/removing liquidity, the greater the user's loss.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user adds liquidity.
2. After a certain period of time, the user removes the liquidity.

Users will lose their vault earnings during this time.

### Impact

Users will lose part of the vault earnings.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended that the trimAllBalances function be called before settling user rewards.
