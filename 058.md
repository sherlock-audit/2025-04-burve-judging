# Missing acceptOwnership() Function Selector Registration Prevents Ownership Transfers

### Summary

Missing function selector registration will cause a permanent inability to complete ownership transfers for protocol administrators as new owners will be unable to call the acceptOwnership() function through the diamond contract.

### Root Cause

As per the README.md:
> We conform to ERC-2535.

This is the Diamond Proxy pattern and the project opts to use the `BaseAdminFacet` as the facet for admin functions. This base facet requires a two-step process for transferring ownership.

For [ERC-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535#:~:text=When%20an%20external%20function%20is%20called%20on%20a%20diamond%20its%20fallback%20function%20is%20executed.%20The%20fallback%20function%20determines%20which%20facet%20to%20call%20based%20on%20the%20first%20four%20bytes%20of%20the%20call%20data%20(known%20as%20the%20function%20selector)%20and%20executes%20that%20function%20from%20the%20facet%20using%20delegatecall.)
> When an external function is called on a diamond its fallback function is executed. The fallback function determines which facet to call based on the first four bytes of the call data (known as the function selector) and executes that function from the facet using delegatecall.

When registering the selectors in [Diamond.sol::constructor()::lines:68-71,](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L68) the adminSelectors array includes only three function selectors from `BaseAdminFacet` (`transferOwnership()`, `owner()`, and `adminRights()`), but omits the crucial `acceptOwnership()` selector. As a result, the ownership cannot be transferred.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Current owner needs to call `transferOwnership()` to initiate an ownership transfer
2. `pendingOwner` in the `AdminRegistry` storage is set to the new owner's address
3. New owner must call `acceptOwnership()` to complete the transfer process

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Current owner calls transferOwnership(newOwner) which succeeds and sets pendingOwner
2. New ownership remains in a pending state, requiring confirmation
3. New owner attempts to call acceptOwnership() to complete the transfer
4. The call reverts with "FunctionNotFound" error because the function selector was never registered in the diamond
5. The ownership transfer cannot be completed, leaving the old owner as the owner

### Impact

The protocol suffers from a permanent inability to complete ownership transfers.

High Impact x Low Likelihood = Medium Severity

### PoC

1. Place the following test into project test folder, it inherits `MultiSetUpTest`, paths for imports will need adjusting:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {console2} from "forge-std/console2.sol";
import {SimplexDiamond} from "../../src/multi/Diamond.sol";
import {IDiamond} from "Commons/Diamond/interfaces/IDiamond.sol";
import {LibDiamond} from "Commons/Diamond/libraries/LibDiamond.sol";

import {MultiSetupTest} from "../facets/MultiSetup.u.sol";

contract AdminFacetTest is MultiSetupTest {
    
    address public owner2 = makeAddr("owner2");
    function setUp() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        _newDiamond();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_changeOwner() public {
        bytes memory _ownerPayload = abi.encodeWithSignature("owner()");

        (bool ok, bytes memory data) = diamond.call(_ownerPayload);
        require(ok);
        console.log("Owner (default owner): ", abi.decode(data, (address)));
        assert(owner == abi.decode(data, (address)));

        vm.startPrank(owner);
        bytes memory payload = abi.encodeWithSignature("transferOwnership(address)", owner2);
        (ok, data) = diamond.call(payload);
        require(ok);
        console.log("transferOwnership() call success");
        vm.stopPrank();

        (ok, data) = diamond.call(_ownerPayload);
        require(ok);
        console.log("Owner after transferOwnership(): ", abi.decode(data, (address)));
        assert(owner == abi.decode(data, (address)));


        bytes memory _acceptOwnerPayload = abi.encodeWithSignature("acceptOwnership()");
        vm.prank(owner2);
        vm.expectRevert();
        diamond.call(_acceptOwnerPayload);
    }
}
```
2. Output:
```diff

### Mitigation

Change the adminSelectors array to include all four function selectors:

```solidity
bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](4);
adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;
adminSelectors[3] = BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership.selector;
```
