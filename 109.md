# Intended Permissive Withdrawal from Locked Vertex Fails in `removeValueSingle` Due to Overriding `isAnyLocked` Check

## Summary

The use of `checkLock=false` in the `Vertex.withdraw` call within `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle` suggests an intention to allow single-sided withdrawals even if the specific vertex is locked. However, this intention is completely negated by a stricter `require(!isAnyLocked(self), ...)` check within the prerequisite `Closure.removeValueSingle` function, causing `removeValueSingle` to revert if *any* vertex in the closure is locked, thus preventing the intended permissive withdrawal.

## Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214

```solidity
 function removeValueSingle(
        address recipient,
        uint16 _closureId,
        uint128 value,
        uint128 bgtValue,
        address token,
        uint128 minReceive
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 removedBalance) {
        ...
        ....
        ....
         (uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(
            value,
            bgtValue,
            vid
        );
        uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
        Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
        ...
        ...
    }

```
The use of `false` in  `Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);` suggest withdrawing even if vertex is locked but the function will always revert because `removeValueSingle` the check is present and reverts if any vertex is locked.

```solidity
    function removeValueSingle(
        Closure storage self,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 bgtValue,
        VertexId vid
    ) internal returns (uint256 removedAmount, uint256 tax) {
        require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
        ....

```

## Impact

The intended design to allow single-sided withdrawals even from closures containing locked vertices (as suggested by the `checkLock=false` parameter in the underlying withdrawal logic) is not achieved for `removeValueSingle`. Users are unexpectedly blocked from using this function if any unrelated token in the closure is locked, forcing them into potentially less desirable proportional withdrawals (`removeValue`) or preventing withdrawal altogether until all locks are cleared.
