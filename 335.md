# Share Price Inflation Attack on ERC4626 Vault

### Summary

The [NoopVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/integrations/pseudo4626/noopVault.sol#L6) contract, which inherits from OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ERC4626`, is vulnerable to a **share price inflation** attack due to the lack of an initial liquidity guard. This enables malicious users to manipulate the exchange rate by making a minimal initial deposit followed by an external donation to the vault.



### Root Cause

The root cause is the absence of any restrictions or initialization logic in the constructor of the `NoopVault`:

```solidity
constructor(
    ERC20 asset,
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol
) ERC20(name, symbol) ERC4626(asset) {}
```

In this setup, the first depositor can:

1. Deposit a minimal amount of the underlying asset (e.g., 1 wei).
2. Receive a proportional number of vault shares (e.g., 1 share).
3. Donate a large amount of the asset directly to the vault (i.e., not via the `deposit()` function).
4. Artificially inflate the share price, making each share worth significantly more.

This behavior stems from how `ERC4626.totalAssets()` reflects the contract's balance of the underlying asset, which increases with donations, but `totalSupply()` remains unaffected, artificially raising the price per share.



### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

Fresh start needed

### Attack Path

1. Vault deployed
2. Attacker deposited 1 wei DAI
3. Attacker donated 100e18 DAI
4. Now, 1 wei share is equal to 100e18 DAI
5. Most probably, all the deposits from trim balance function will mint 0 share for the reserve

### Impact

This inflation mechanism may cause 0 share minting for ReserveLib deposits because ReserveLib only deposits the accrued fee to vault. If the price for one share is so high, it will directly cause loss of funds for the liquidity providers in the system.

It also affects normal deposits through vault and may cause loss of funds for the depositors.


### Mitigation

Internal accounting is much better way to track the balance
