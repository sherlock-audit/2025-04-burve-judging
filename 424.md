# Pool Instability via Silent Target Value Shift in Single-Token Adds

### Summary

The protocol defines a nonlinear value function:

$$
V(x) = (e+2)t - \frac{(e+1)^2 t^2}{et + x}
$$

Where:

* $e$ is a protocol-defined constant (default: 10)
* $x$ is a token’s balance
* $t$ is the target value, calculated as $t = \frac{\text{totalValue}}{n}$, where $n$ is the token count

The function becomes **undefined (negative)** when:

$$
x < \frac{t}{e + 2}
$$

To protect against this, the `setBalance()` function enforces a minimum $x$ threshold per token using a precalculated `minXPerTX128`. However, this check is only enforced **on the updated token** (e.g., USDC during a single-token deposit), not globally across all tokens.

This leads to a **silent global invariant violation**: updating only one token (e.g., USDC) increases the total pool value and thus increases the derived `t`—raising the minimum valid $x$ for **all tokens**. If another token (e.g., DAI) was already near its minimum, this global shift can push it **below** the valid range, causing future operations to fail due to negative or undefined value outputs.




### Root Cause

In [setBalance()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L820):

```solidity
uint256 minX = FullMath.mulX256(
    Store.simplex().minXPerTX128[idx],
    self.targetX128,
    true
);
```

This verifies that the new balance for **`idx`** remains above its calculated minimum. However, when increasing the total pool value via a single-token addition, the underlying `targetX128` increases, shifting **`minX` for all tokens**—not just the one being updated.

Because `setBalance()` is only called on the token being updated, this leaves other token balances unchecked, despite their invariants being silently invalidated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

This attack vector is not possible for small closures like 2 tokens because we also apply limit for increase the token balance. No balance can exceed 2t range and small closures like 2 tokens can't reach that situation. But it's possible in big closures. You can test it in following Desmos link:

In this graph, `f(t)` function is equal to optimize function we used in addTokenForValue calculations. Therefore, y = 0 points are optimized points for target. For instance, if when x axis is equal to 1.2e24, y is equal to 0 it means 1.2e24 is optimal target for this closure. In the graph, c describes the other tokens in the pool and b describes the token which is really close to t/(e+2) point. 

In the provided example optimal target is 1.218172e24 but our b token balance is 1e23 which is lower than t/(e+2) value and none of the tokens exceed 2t ( 1.3e24 max in example ). Therefore, this situation may occur in single token addition in c set.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Described in internal pre-condition

### Impact

* A token balance (e.g., DAI) can fall below the safe threshold $x < \frac{t}{e+2}$, making $V(x)$ negative.
* This leads to:

  * Reverts on any function using the value function: swaps and single adds, or removals won't work anymore ( Normal add/remove value will work )
  * Silent corruption of internal accounting

This creates a critical failure that can be triggered by any user performing single-token deposits when the system is near edge thresholds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In single token additions check other tokens as well
