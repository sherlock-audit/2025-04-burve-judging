# Incorrect rounding direction in `Closure::removeTokenForValue` could cause DoS in the pool when `totalValue == bgtValue`

### Summary

When calculating `bgtValue` in `Closure::removeTokenForValue`, X256 precision is used for the percentage of `bgtValue` to withdraw. However, the result is **rounded down**, leading to a deduction of slightly less `bgtValue` than intended, causing `bgtValue` to be **greater** than `value`:

```solidity
uint256 valueX128 = ((self.targetX128 - newTargetX128) * self.n);
value = valueX128 >> 128;
if ((value << 128) > 0) value += 1; // Round up.

bgtValue = FullMath.mulX256(value, bgtPercentX256, false); // Convention: round BGT down.
self.targetX128 = newTargetX128;
self.setBalance(idx, self.balances[idx]);

self.valueStaked -= value;
self.bgtValueStaked -= bgtValue;
```

### Root Cause

In `Closure::removeTokenForValue`, rounding down `bgtValue` during withdrawal creates an inconsistency where `bgtValue` exceeds `value`, violating assumptions elsewhere in the code. This eventually triggers a revert in Closure functions that invoke [`[trimBalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L723)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L723).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `value == bgtValue` is expected.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Initial state:
   - `valueStaked = 100e18`
   - `bgtValueStaked = 100e18`
2. User removes 50 `value` and 100% `bgtPercentX256`:
   - `bgtValue = FullMath.mulX256(50e18, type(uint256).max, false) = 49.999999999999999999`
3. Updated state:
   - `valueStaked = 50e18`
   - `bgtValueStaked = 50e18 + 1`
4. Now `bgtValueStaked > valueStaked`, which causes all future calls to `trimBalance` to revert, resulting in a complete DoS of the Closure contract.

### Impact

- **Complete DoS** (Denial of Service) of the Closure contract.
- Users are permanently blocked from interacting with affected pools.

### PoC

_None provided._

### Mitigation

Adjust the `bgtValue` calculation:
- Round **up** instead of down.
- Cap `bgtValue` at a maximum of `value`.

This ensures consistency between `value` and `bgtValue`, preventing potential DoS conditions.
