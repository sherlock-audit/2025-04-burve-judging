# Missing Backup Vault Check will cause Unexpected Reverts and DoS for Users

### Summary

A missing explicit check on the backup vault's available balance/withdrawable amount before attempting withdrawal in `VaultProxy.withdraw` will cause an unexpected and uninformative revert (panic 0x11 due to arithmetic underflow) for users/callers when a user initiates a withdrawal that requires drawing funds from the backup vault, and the required amount exceeds the backup vault's actual available balance for the specific closure.

### Root Cause

In VaultProxy.sol#L187-L203 within the withdraw function, when the withdrawal amount exceeds the amount available in the active vault (amount > available), the code directly calls self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available) without first checking **if the backup vault actually holds sufficient balance or has sufficient withdrawable liquidity for the requested amount - available**.


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L187-L203:
```solidity
    /// Withdraw from the active vault, and then the backup if we can't fulfill it entirely.
    function withdraw(
        VaultProxy memory self,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        // We effectively don't allow withdraws beyond uint128 due to the capping in balance.
        uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
        uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
        if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

        if (amount > available) {
            self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
            self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available); // <=== missing check amount >= available
        } else {
            self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
        }
    }
```

The underlying VaultPointer.withdraw delegates to VaultE4626.withdraw, which also relies on implicit underflow checks (self.shares[cid] -= sharesToRemove) rather than explicit balance checks before updating internal share accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. An owner needs to call VaultFacet.addVault and subsequently VaultFacet.acceptVault (after the ADD_DELAY) to set a backup vault address for a specific VertexId (token).

2. Liquidity associated with a specific ClosureId (cid) needs to exist, at least partially, within the backup vault. This can happen via VaultFacet.transferBalance.

3. A user needs to initiate a withdrawal (e.g., via ValueFacet.removeSingleForValue) for an amount such that amount is greater than the balance available for withdrawal from the active vault for that cid.

4. The remaining amount needed from the backup vault (amount - available_from_active) must be greater than the actual balance held by the backup vault for that specific cid.

### External Pre-conditions

None required. This vulnerability depends on internal state and logic flow.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls a function like `ValueFacet.removeSingleForValue`, requesting to withdraw amount of a specific token associated with VertexId vid and ClosureId cid.

2. The call eventually reaches `VaultProxyImpl.withdraw(proxy, cid, amount)`.

3. The function calculates available balance/withdrawable from proxy.active.

4. The condition amount > available evaluates to true.

5. proxy.active.withdraw(cid, available) is called.

6. `proxy.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available)` is called without checking if the backup vault has amount - available balance for cid.

7. This call delegates down to VaultE4626.withdraw for the backup vault.

8. `VaultE4626.withdraw` calculates the required shares to remove (sharesToRemove) based on the requested asset amount (amount - available). Because this requested amount exceeds the actual assets held by cid in the backup vault, the calculated sharesToRemove will be greater than the shares actually held (self.shares[cid]).

9. The operation self.shares[cid] -= sharesToRemove; attempts to subtract a larger number from a smaller number.

10. An arithmetic underflow occurs, triggering Solidity's default behavior.

11. The entire transaction reverts with panic: `arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11)`.

### Impact

The lack of explicit pre-checks before attempting withdrawal from the backup vault leads to several significant risks beyond mere user inconvenience:

1. **Denial of Service (DoS) & Fund Unavailability**: Legitimate user withdrawal attempts that correctly span across active and backup vaults can be unexpectedly blocked by the opaque panic 0x11 if the backup vault is even slightly deficient for that specific closure's share. This effectively denies service for withdrawals following this path and makes user funds temporarily unavailable until the precise state causing the underflow is resolved or sufficient balance is restored to the backup vault. While the revert prevents direct loss in this specific step, the inability to withdraw constitutes a functional freezing of assets for the user via this path.

2. **Impeded Protocol Operations & Migration Risks**: The reliance on implicit underflow panics severely hinders critical administrative functions managed via VaultFacet, such as vault migrations (transferBalance, hotSwap) or emergency fund movements. If issues arise during these complex, multi-step processes that require drawing funds from a backup vault, the non-specific revert makes diagnosing the root cause (e.g., genuine lack of funds vs. an unrelated accounting error triggering the panic) extremely difficult and time-consuming. This increases the risk profile of essential maintenance and upgrade operations, potentially delaying them or leading to administrator errors in high-pressure situations, indirectly risking funds if recovery actions are blocked or mishandled due to lack of clarity.

3. **System Fragility & Hidden Failure Modes**: Depending on implicit checks makes the system more fragile. Edge cases in VaultE4626's share calculation or unforeseen interactions with the commit mechanism could potentially trigger this underflow panic even when sufficient external funds exist, leading to failures that are hard to predict or debug. This lack of robustness obscures the system's true state and behavior.

4. **Erosion of Trust**: Persistent, uninformative transaction failures damage user and integrator trust, potentially leading to capital flight as participants perceive the protocol as unreliable or poorly implemented.

In summary, while the underflow revert prevents immediate state corruption, the failure to implement explicit, informative checks before backup vault withdrawal attempts creates significant DoS risks for users, complicates critical protocol operations, increases systemic fragility, and undermines trust.

### PoC

To simplify, I modifiy the `validateOwner` function in `Admin.sol`:
```solidity
    function validateOwner() internal view {
        // if (msg.sender != adminStore().owner) {
        //     revert NotOwner();
        // }
    }
```

And I add a test function in `VaultFacet.t.sol`:
```solidity
// test VaultFacet `transferBalance`
    function testTransferBalance() public {
        // --- Minimal Setup ---
        uint16 cid = 0x3; // Use a simple Closure ID (ensure initialized in setUp or MultiSetupTest)
        address user = address(this); // Test contract itself as user and liquidity provider
        uint256 initialValue = 10e18; // Add a small amount of initial liquidity value (needs both tokens, assume ~5e18 each)
        // uint256 approxTokenAmount = 5e18; // Approximate corresponding token[0] amount - removed as unused according to previous warning

        // 1. Add initial liquidity (defaults to active vault)
        // Assuming user (address(this)) was funded with both tokens via _fundAccount
        vm.prank(user);
        valueFacet.addValue(user, cid, uint128(initialValue), 0);

        // 2. Add and accept backup vault (requires Owner permission)
        vm.startPrank(owner); // Assuming owner is correctly set in setUp
        v.addVault(tokens[0], altVaults[0], VaultType.E4626); // Add backup for tokens[0]
        skip(5 days + 1); // Skip time lock delay
        v.acceptVault(tokens[0]);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // 3. Get vault addresses and transfer entire balance from active vault to backup vault
        (address activeVault, address backupVault) = v.viewVaults(tokens[0]);
        uint256 balanceToTransfer = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(activeVault);

        // Only transfer if there's balance in the active vault
        if (balanceToTransfer > 0) {
            vm.startPrank(owner);
            // Transfer the entire balance for this cid from active to backup
            v.transferBalance(activeVault, backupVault, cid, balanceToTransfer);
            vm.stopPrank();
        }

        // 4. Check state: active vault should be near empty, backup vault should have the transferred balance
        uint256 activeBalanceFinal = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(activeVault);
        uint256 backupBalanceFinal = IERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(backupVault);
        assertTrue(activeBalanceFinal <= 10, "Setup Fail: Active vault not empty after transfer"); // Allow dust
        assertGt(backupBalanceFinal, 0, "Setup Fail: Backup vault empty after transfer");
        // Check backup balance consistency (should be approx balanceToTransfer)
        assertApproxEqAbs(backupBalanceFinal, balanceToTransfer, 1000, "Check Fail: Backup balance mismatch after transfer");


        // --- Trigger and Assertion ---
        // Attempt to withdraw slightly more token[0] than exists in the backup vault
        uint256 withdrawAmount = backupBalanceFinal + 1e16; // Request slightly more than backup balance

        // --- Add console logs before the expected revert ---
        console.log("--- Preparing to Trigger Backup Underflow ---");
        console.log("Total withdrawal amount requested (withdrawAmount):", withdrawAmount);
        console.log("Active Vault final balance (activeBalanceFinal): ", activeBalanceFinal);
        console.log("Backup Vault final balance (backupBalanceFinal): ", backupBalanceFinal);
        // Calculate the amount VaultProxyImpl will attempt to withdraw from Backup
        // Note: This approximates internal logic and ignores potential small tax effects for clarity
        uint256 amountToWithdrawFromBackup = withdrawAmount - activeBalanceFinal;
        // Prevent underflow in log calculation itself if activeBalanceFinal > withdrawAmount (should not happen here)
        if (activeBalanceFinal > withdrawAmount) { amountToWithdrawFromBackup = 0; }
        console.log("Amount expected to be withdrawn from Backup (remainder):", amountToWithdrawFromBackup);
        console.log("Condition Check: (Amount from Backup > Backup Balance)?", amountToWithdrawFromBackup > backupBalanceFinal); // Should print true

        // Expectation: VaultProxyImpl.withdraw -> active.withdraw(~0) -> backup.withdraw(>backupBalanceFinal)
        // -> VaultE4626.withdraw(backup, ..., >backupBalanceFinal) -> shares[cid] -= sharesToRemove (underflow!)

        // Expect arithmetic error (underflow)

        vm.prank(user);
        // Call removeSingleForValue requesting the exact amount of tokens[0]
        valueFacet.removeSingleForValue(user, cid, tokens[0], uint128(withdrawAmount), 0, 0);

        // If execution reaches here, the expected revert did not happen, test will fail.
        console.log("!!! Test Failed: Expected Revert did not occur !!!"); // Optional fail log

    }

```

Run test with 
```bash
forge test --match-test "testTransferBalance" -vvvv
```
