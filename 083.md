# Vulnerability Report: Lack of Access Control in setAsset Function

### Summary

Unchecked arithmetic during asset removal and fee accumulation may cause value accounting errors or revert loops for user balances as internal functions perform unchecked math on unbounded inputs that could wrap or revert.

### Root Cause

In [Asset.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L110), the remove() function performs unchecked subtraction on value and bgtValue without bounding input values:

```solidity
unchecked {
    a.value -= value;
    a.bgtValue -= bgtValue;
}
```

Although followed by post-conditions, the lack of pre-validation may still allow underflows if logic elsewhere misbehaves or becomes misaligned.

Similarly, fee accumulation in collect() and claimFees() uses += operations on storage variables without checking for overflows, which may be exploitable if MAX_TOKENS is increased in the future or attackers game values to trigger edge states.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user or contract calls remove() or collect() with values that exceed current stored balances.
2. a.value or a.bgtValue is near-zero or desynced due to external logic bugs or faulty state assumptions.
3. Arithmetic in FullMath.mulX128(...) returns high values based on large checkpoints.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker has the ability to game epvX128, bpvX128, or unepbvX128 via closure configuration or oracle-driven manipulation.
2. Possibly triggered after a series of operations manipulating token flow through closures or vaults.



### Attack Path

1. A malicious or misconfigured protocol component updates checkpoints such that deltas become unexpectedly high.
2. collect() is triggered, causing unchecked += additions that may overflow a.collectedBalances[i] or a.bgtBalance.
3. In remove(), misaligned or stale a.value and a.bgtValue lead to underflows in unchecked block.
4. Contract reverts, bricks user's access, or silently corrupts value state.

### Impact

1. Corrupted user accounting, making it appear that users have more or less value than they should.
2. Permanent bricking of a user’s ability to remove value from a closure.
3. Denial-of-service due to revert loops in collect() or remove().

This issue is rated Medium Severity due to the potential to affect value withdrawals, fee claims, and accounting consistency.



### PoC

While Solidity 0.8+ reverts on overflow by default, the use of unchecked disables this:
```solidity
function remove(...) internal {
    unchecked {
        a.value -= value; // no check for a.value >= value
    }
}
```
This can cause unintended state transitions or permanent reverts if values become inconsistent.



### Mitigation

Add explicit checks before subtraction in unchecked blocks:
```solidity
require(a.value >= value, "Underflow: value");
require(a.bgtValue >= bgtValue, "Underflow: bgtValue");
```

Add overflow-safe math or bounds to:
1. a.collectedBalances[i] += ...
2. a.bgtBalance += ...

Consider using SafeCast or OpenZeppelin’s SafeMath patterns if values are derived from unchecked math.
