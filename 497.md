# Price Manipulation Vulnerability in Burve Due to Direct Use of UniswapV3 slot0

### Summary

Reliance on the instantaneous price from Uniswap V3's slot0 for critical calculations will cause potential fund loss for protocol users as malicious actors can manipulate pool prices using flash loans or sandwich attacks to extract value during minting, burning, and compounding operations.

### Root Cause

In [Burve.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L743-L744), the protocol repeatedly uses the instantaneous price from UniswapV3's slot0 for critical price calculations:

```solidity
(uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
```

This value is then used for key operations including minting, burning, calculating position values, and compounding fees. The instantaneous price is easily manipulable by MEV bots, flash loan attacks, and sandwich attacks because it represents the most recent trade price rather than a time-weighted average.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol must perform operations that depend on the current price, such as minting, burning, or compounding.
2. The operations must involve sizable liquidity to make price manipulation profitable.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The underlying Uniswap V3 pool must have sufficient liquidity to be manipulated without prohibitively high slippage.
2. The attacker must have access to significant capital (or flash loans) to move the pool price temporarily.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker detects a pending mint, burn, or compound transaction in the mempool.
2. Attacker executes the first part of a sandwich attack, manipulating the price in the Uniswap V3 pool.
3. The victim's transaction executes using the manipulated price from slot0.
4. Attacker completes the sandwich by returning the price to its original state.
5. As a result, the victim:
   - Receives fewer LP tokens than expected (if minting)
   - Receives fewer underlying tokens than expected (if burning)
   - Has their fees reinvested at suboptimal rates (if compounding)

### Impact

Users of the protocol suffer financial losses due to price manipulation:
- During minting: Users receive fewer LP shares than they should for their deposited tokens.
- During burning: Users receive fewer underlying tokens than their LP shares are actually worth.
- During compounding: Protocol-wide returns are reduced as fees are reinvested at suboptimal prices.

The magnitude of loss depends on the size of transactions and the degree of price manipulation, but could be significant for large liquidity providers or during periods of high volatility.


### PoC

1. Use Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) instead of the instantaneous price from slot0:
   ```solidity
   // Instead of:
   (uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
   
   // Use Uniswap's TWAP oracle:
   uint32 twapInterval = 900; // 15 minutes
   uint160 sqrtRatioX96 = getTimeWeightedAverageSqrtPriceX96(twapInterval);
   ```
