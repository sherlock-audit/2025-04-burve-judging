# liquidity fees are not collected when Burning shares

## Summary
The burn function allows user to burn shares of LP token in the pool, the user LP token pool can be minted either in uniswapPool or island pool. However when burning shares it fails to withdraw fees from contract. Liquidity accumulated fees would be lost
## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
    /// @notice Burns share of the island on behalf of msg.sender.
    /// @param shares The amount of Burve LP token to burn.
    /// @return islandBurnShares The amount of island shares burned.
    function burnIsland(
        uint256 shares
    ) internal returns (uint256 islandBurnShares) {
        // calculate island shares to burn
        islandBurnShares = FullMath.mulDiv(
            islandSharesPerOwner[msg.sender],
            shares,
            balanceOf(msg.sender)
        );

        if (islandBurnShares == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        islandSharesPerOwner[msg.sender] -= islandBurnShares;
        totalIslandShares -= islandBurnShares;

        // withdraw burn shares from the station proxy
        stationProxy.withdrawLP(address(island), islandBurnShares, msg.sender);
        island.burn(islandBurnShares, address(this));
    }

```
As we can see it burns shares from the isalnd withoud calculating the fees accumulated for the liquidity owner , The liquidity provider provides liquidity to earn fees from swaps and from users that interacts in the pool, However the user would recieve his liquidity balance without transferring fees gained
## Impact
Loss of fess for the liquidity provider
## Recommended Mitigation
Define a mechanism to withdraw accumulated fees for both uniswap pool and island
