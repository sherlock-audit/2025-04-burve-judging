# Missing `isAnyLocked()` check in `removeValue` function in closure

### Summary

As the title suggests, there is a missing `isAnyLocked()` check in the `removeValue` function. For comparison, similar functions like `removeTokenForValue`, `removeValueSingle` have this check for emergencies (like depegs). Not having this check will result in tokens being withdrawn even when the protocol does not want to do so.

### Root Cause

[`isAnyLocked`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L879-L892) is defined as:

```solidity
    function isAnyLocked(
        Closure storage self
    ) internal returns (bool isLocked) {
        for (
            VertexId vIter = VertexLib.minId();
            !vIter.isStop();
            vIter = vIter.inc()
        ) {
            if (self.cid.contains(vIter)) {
                if (Store.vertex(vIter).isLocked()) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```

Functions like `removeValueSingle` have the check:

`require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));`

So, this prevents the tokens from being withdrawn/removed if any of the vertices in the closure are locked. But this check is missing in `removeValue` function.

### Internal Pre-conditions

One of the vertices is locked.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Described in the root cause

### Impact

The vertices can be locked during emergencies (eg, during depegs). Not restricting tokens from being withdrawn could unfairly allow users to withdraw depegged tokens during emergencies. If there are only 2 tokens in a closure, and they both suffer depegs. Then it unfairly allows users to withdraw such tokens, and then again deposit them when they re-peg back. Hence, the protocol needs to be locked in such situations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the check in the `removeValue` function as well.
