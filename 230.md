# Uninitialized Variable Used in Tax Computation in `removeValueSingle`

### Summary

The `removeValueSingle` function in the contract uses the variable `removedBalance` to compute `realTax` before `removedBalance` is initialized. This results in an always-zero tax being calculated and charged, which silently breaks the intended tax mechanism and impacts protocol earnings.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L235` The calculation of `realTax` incorrectly uses the variable `removedBalance` before it is assigned a value. Instead, the tax should be computed based on `realRemoved`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `removeValueSingle` is called.

- `realRemoved`, `nominalTax`, and `removedNominal` are all non-zero.

- No prior assignment to `removedBalance` has occurred.

### External Pre-conditions

- A user triggers value withdrawal from a closure.

- The contract has tax parameters set (i.e., `nominalTax > 0`).

### Attack Path

1. A user withdraws value using removeValueSingle.

2. The function computes tax as:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
    removedBalance,  // uninitialized here
    nominalTax,
    removedNominal
);
```
3. Since `removedBalance` is uninitialized (default 0), `realTax` is calculated as 0.

4. The user receives the full balance (`removedBalance = realRemoved - 0`).

5. The protocol collects no fees for this withdrawal.

### Impact

- Tax is never deducted during withdrawals due to the use of a default-zero variable.

- The protocol loses expected revenue.

- Accounting errors propagate silently without triggering any exceptions.

- Inconsistency with addValueSingle tax logic increases risk of future bugs.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the incorrect `removedBalance` usage with the already calculated `realRemoved` for tax computation:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
    realRemoved,
    nominalTax,
    removedNominal
);
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;
```
This ensures tax is calculated correctly based on actual removed value and aligns with the protocolâ€™s intended behavior.
