# Incorrect Tax Calculation Leading to Zero Real Tax Affecting the fees collected for the protocol

### Summary

An incorrectly computed tax in the `removeValueSingle `function inside the `ValueFacet.sol` contract will cause a financial loss for a closure as the protocol will not be able to collect fees when the user removes value from the closure.



### Root Cause

In the `removeValueSingle `function at line  `ValueFacet.sol:214`:
`uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);`
the use of the uninitialized variable `removedBalance ` (defaulting to 0) in the `FullMath.mulDiv` calculation results in `realTax ` being computed as 0, regardless of the `nominalTax` returned by `c.removeValueSingle`. Essentially this is incorrect because `realTax` depends on `removedBalance`, creating a circular dependency. This prevents any tax from being deducted from the withdrawal and no earnings from being added to the closure.
On line `ValueFacet.sol:240` Zero tax will be added to the protocol `c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);`

### Internal Pre-conditions

None. The issue is a logical error in the code and does not require specific internal state conditions beyond the function being callable.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user deposits into a closure with the pair of tokens they desire.
2. The user calls `removeValueSingle` with:
• recipient = their address.
• Valid `_closureId`, `value`,` bgtValue <= value`, token, and `minReceive`.
3. The function executes:
• `Store.assets().remove` deducts value from the user’s assets.
• c.`removeValueSingle` returns `removedNominal` and `nominalTax`.
• `Store.vertex(vid).withdraw` withdraws `realRemoved`.
4. The tax calculation uses `removedBalance = 0` (uninitialized):
• `realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(0, 100, 1000) = 0`.
5. `c.addEarnings(vid, 0)` adds no earnings to the closure.
6. `removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax = 10000 - 0 = 10000` for an example. User walks away with paying no tax

### Impact

The closure and protocol suffers an approximate loss of the expected tax revenue (e.g., % of each withdrawal’s real value).  The user gains the full withdrawal amount instead of the expected post-tax amount.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Replace `removedBalance `with `realRemoved ` in the `realTax `calculation:


`uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);`

This ensures `realTax `reflects the proportional tax based on `nominalTax `and `realRemoved`.
