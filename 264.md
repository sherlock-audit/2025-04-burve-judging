# Approval race protected assets are not supported

### Summary

Approval race protected assets may freeze the closure due to breaking the allowance rule such as USDT token

### Root Cause

Every liquidity provider should provide a percentage amount for receiving his earnings with BGT as ratio. Whenever a new reward is tracked in the vaults this reward is distributed to providers based on the total BGT receiving ratio. Trim balance function is triggered and then this BGT amount is exchanged by using BGT exchanger contract.

```solidity

/// Closure contract

        if (self.bgtValueStaked > 0) {
            (uint256 bgtEarned, uint256 unspent) = SimplexLib.bgtExchange(
                idx,
                bgtReal
            );
            self.bgtPerBgtValueX128 += (bgtEarned << 128) / self.bgtValueStaked;
            // rare
            if (unspent > 0) {
                uint256 unspentShares = ReserveLib.deposit(vid, unspent);
                self.unexchangedPerBgtValueX128[idx] +=
                    (unspentShares << 128) /
                    self.bgtValueStaked;
            }
        }

/// Simplex contract

    function bgtExchange(
        uint8 idx,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal returns (uint256 bgtEarned, uint256 unspent) {
        Simplex storage s = Store.simplex();
        if (s.bgtEx == address(0)) return (0, amount);
        address token = TokenRegLib.getToken(idx);
        uint256 spentAmount;
&>      SafeERC20.forceApprove(IERC20(token), s.bgtEx, amount);
        (bgtEarned, spentAmount) = IBGTExchanger(s.bgtEx).exchange(
            token,
            uint128(amount) // safe cast since amount cant possibly be more than 1e30
        );
        unspent = amount - spentAmount;
    }
```

In here, [simplex contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Simplex.sol#L124) is responsible to exchange this BGT amount with earnings. It increase the approval amount for BGT exchanger contract with required amount. But it doesn't set back to value 0 and as we know approval race protected tokens such as USDT will revert the transaction if we try to approve another amount than 0 while we have already approval which is not equal to 0.


```solidity
    function viewExchange(
        address inToken,
        uint128 amount
    ) public view returns (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) {
        // If rate is zero, the spendAmount remains zero.
        bgtAmount = FullMath.mulX128(rate[inToken], amount, false);

        if (bgtBalance < bgtAmount) {
            bgtAmount = bgtBalance;
            // Rate won't be zero here or else bgtAmount is 0 and can't be more.
            amount = uint128(
                FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(bgtAmount, 1 << 128, rate[inToken])
            );
        }

        if (bgtAmount != 0) {
            spendAmount = amount;
        }
    }
```

In here, if BGT amount is not enough to cover requested amount in BGT exchanger, this missing amount is covered with earning token. Therefore, there is always a possibility to not use whole approval amount.


### Internal Pre-conditions

BGT exchanger contract doesn't have enough BGT balance to cover earnings

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

Actually, attacker can trigger this attack vector by just creating his own earnings at the beginning of the pool creation. Because vaults are regular ERC4626 contracts which accepts direct donations.

Attacker can simply add some value to closure which has USDT token with 100% BGT earnings expectation and then he can donate to USDT vault in order to trigger trim balance functionality. With that way, he can completelly freeze the closure until new upgrade of approval.

This bug can also be triggered in natural way of course.

### Impact

The whole closure is freezed due to bug and can't operate until the next upgrade because trim balance function is almost called before every function. Only swap feature will work until the next upgrade.


### Mitigation

Add approve 0 line after transfer
