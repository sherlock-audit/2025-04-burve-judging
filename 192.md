# BGTExchanger Backup Chain Missing Repayment Sync Allows Repeated Withdrawals of Same Debt

## Brief

The settlement logic of [BGTExchanger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L127) allows the same debt entry to be withdrawn repeatedly whenever two or more exchanger instances are linked through the `setBackup()` mechanism.

`getOwed()` aggregates all “owed” balances along the backup-chain, yet `withdraw()` only records the repayment in the instance that processes the call. Consequently a user can cash-out the same BGT entitlement from each exchanger in the chain, draining the protocol’s BGT reserves far beyond the legitimate total.

## Details

### 1. How the accounting is supposed to work

Each exchanger maintains three local tables:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public owed;       // newly created debt
mapping(address => uint256) public withdrawn;  // repayments processed here
uint256                         bgtBalance;    // liquid BGT held here

```

`exchange()` increases `owed[user]` in **this** contract;

`withdraw()` should later pay that amount once and only once.

### 2. The backup mechanism

To migrate liquidity an owner may point one exchanger at another:

```solidity
function setBackup(address backup) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();
    backupEx = IBGTExchanger(backup);
}

```

When an exchanger has a backup, `getOwed()` sums the debt of the whole chain:

```solidity
function getOwed(address u) public view returns (uint256 o) {
    o  = owed[u];                               // local debt
    if (address(backupEx) != address(0))
        o += backupEx.getOwed(u);               // recurse into backup(s)
    o -= withdrawn[u];                          // LOCAL repayments only
}

```

### 3. Missing state synchronisation

The aggregation step (`+= backupEx.getOwed`) is global, but the repayment step is purely local:

```solidity
function withdraw(address to, uint256 amt) external {
    uint256 owedTotal = getOwed(msg.sender);    // global view
    require(owedTotal >= amt, "InsufficientOwed");

    withdrawn[msg.sender] += amt;               // LOCAL write only
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, to, amt);
}

```

No record is written back to the upstream exchanger(s).

Therefore upstream contracts continue to report the full debt, allowing it to be withdrawn again.

### 4. Exploitable flow

```solidity
User earns 100 BGT in Exchanger A          →  A.owed[user] = 100
Owner deploys Exchanger B, sets backup=A   →  B.backupEx   =  A
User calls B.withdraw(100)                 →  pays 100, B.withdrawn = 100
                                            →  A’s state unchanged
Owner (later) deploys Exchanger C, backup=A
User calls C.withdraw(100) or A.withdraw() →  pays another 100

```

The debt can be recast and withdrawn any number of times, limited only by the BGT that each front-end exchanger holds.

### 5. S**upportive** design issues that amplify the bug

- `setBackup()` performs no validation – duplicate use, token mismatch, or circular graphs are all accepted.
- Recursion in `getOwed()` has **no cycle guard** and can revert via out-of-gas.
- No events are emitted on withdrawal, hampering off-chain reconciliation.

## Impact

An attacker can repeatedly withdraw the same BGT entitlement from every exchanger that references the original one, achieving an arbitrary-large “double spend” of the protocol’s reward token and rendering all BGT accounting insolvent.
