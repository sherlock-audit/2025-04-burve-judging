# # Omitted `acceptOwnership`  selector blocks the completion of OwnershipTransfer

### Summary

## Summary
The `acceptOwnership` function from the `BaseAdminFacet` is not included in the diamond cut. As a result, the diamond proxy cannot route calls to it, making it impossible to complete the ownership transfer process once it has been initiated.

### Root Cause

## Root Cause
The issue stems from the [constructor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L68-L77) of the `SimplexDiamond` contract, only a subset of the `BaseAdminFacet` function selectors are added:
```solidity
{
    bytes4 ;
    adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
    adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
    adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;
    // @audit-issue: acceptOwnership() is not included
    cuts[2] = FacetCut({
        facetAddress: address(new BaseAdminFacet()),
        action: FacetCutAction.Add,
        functionSelectors: adminSelectors
    });
}
```
Although the `transferOwnership`, `owner`, and `adminRights` functions are registered, the `acceptOwnership` function is mistakenly excluded. This oversight prevents the proxy from dispatching calls to `acceptOwnership`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

## Internal Preconditions:

1.  The diamond proxy must be deployed.

2.  The BaseAdminFacet must be correctly attached to the diamond.

3.  The current owner must call transferOwnership to initiate the handover.

### External Pre-conditions

## External Preconditions:

1.  The designated new owner must be able to submit transactions on-chain.

### Attack Path

## Attack Path
1.  The current owner calls `transferOwnership(newOwner)` through the diamond proxy.

2.  The `BaseAdminFacet` updates the internal pendingOwner state.

3.  The new owner attempts to call `acceptOwnership()` to finalize the transfer.

4.  The diamond proxyâ€™s fallback attempts to route the call based on the selector.

5.  Since the `acceptOwnership` selector is not present, the call fails with a `FunctionNotFound` error.

### Impact

## Impact
This issue effectively breaks the ownership handover process. Specifically:

The new owner cannot assume control of the contract.

### PoC

## PoC
// (1) In `MultiSetup.u.sol`,
```diff

    // Add this  import
+   import {BaseAdminFacet} from "Commons/Util/Admin.sol";

    // make the following modifications
    contract MultiSetupTest is Test {
            /* Diamond */
        ---snip---
        // Add this
+       BaseAdminFacet public baseAdminFacet;

        ---snip---

        function _newDiamond() internal {
            ---snip---
            // Add this
+           baseAdminFacet = BaseAdminFacet(diamond);
            ---snip---
        }
    }
```
// (2) Create a new test file => `test/facets/BaseAdminFacet.t.sol` and paste the following:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BUSL-1.1
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import {MultiSetupTest} from "./MultiSetup.u.sol";

contract BaseAdminFacetTest is MultiSetupTest {
    function setUp() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        _newDiamond();
        _newTokens(3);
        _initializeClosure(0x7);
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function testRevertInAcceptOwnership() public {
        address bob = makeAddr("bob");

        vm.startPrank(owner);
        // owner initiates transfer to bob
        baseAdminFacet.transferOwnership(bob);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // bob attempts to accept ownership
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        // This reverts 
        vm.expectRevert();
        baseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership();
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```
// (3) Run: `forge test --mt testRevertInAcceptOwnership -vvvv`

### Mitigation

## Mitigation
Include this selector in the diamond cuts:
```diff
        {
-           bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](3);
+           bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](4);
            adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
            adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
            adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;
+           adminSelectors[3] = BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership.selector;
            cuts[2] = FacetCut({
                facetAddress: address(new BaseAdminFacet()),
                action: FacetCutAction.Add,
                functionSelectors: adminSelectors
            });
        }
```
