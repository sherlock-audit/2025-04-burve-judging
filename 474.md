# Missing Division by Q128

### Summary

A critical mathematical error in the fee calculation logic will cause users to receive 2^128 (approximately 3.4 * 10^38) times more fees than they should, as the protocol fails to divide by Q128 when calculating accumulated fees, resulting in catastrophic token drainage from the protocol.


### Root Cause

In [Fees.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Fees.sol#L48-L60), the `viewAccumulatedFees` function uses `X128.mul256` to calculate fees but fails to divide the result by Q128:

```solidity
tokensOwed0 = uint128(
    X128.mul256(
        liquidity,
        feeGrowthInside0X128 - feeGrowthInside0LastX128
    )
);
tokensOwed1 = uint128(
    X128.mul256(
        liquidity,
        feeGrowthInside1X128 - feeGrowthInside1LastX128
    )
);
```

The correct implementation should divide by Q128 (1 << 128) to maintain the proper fixed-point arithmetic, as seen in Uniswap V3's implementation:

```solidity
// From Uniswap V3 Position.sol
tokensOwed0 += uint128(
    FullMath.mulDiv(
        liquidity,
        feeGrowthInside0X128 - feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
        FixedPoint128.Q128
    )
);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A position must have accrued fees (non-zero feeGrowth delta).
2. A user must call a function that uses `viewAccumulatedFees` to calculate and claim fees.


### External Pre-conditions

None required; this is a pure mathematical error in the protocol's internal logic.

### Attack Path

1. User creates a position in the protocol.
2. Position accrues even a tiny amount of fees.
3. User calls a function that calculates and claims fees.
4. Due to the missing division by Q128, the user receives 2^128 times more tokens than they should.
5. Protocol rapidly drains of tokens, potentially emptying the entire pool.

### Impact

The protocol suffers catastrophic financial loss as users receive vastly inflated fee amounts. For example:
- If a user should receive 0.1 tokens in fees, they would instead receive 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211.5 tokens
- This would immediately drain the entire protocol of tokens, making it insolvent
- First users to claim would receive all available tokens, leaving nothing for other users

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the fee calculation in `viewAccumulatedFees` to divide by Q128
