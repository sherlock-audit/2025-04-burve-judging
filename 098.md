# Emergency Withdrawals Can Leave User Funds Stuck in ParetoDollarQueue.sol

### Summary

The lack of a proper reentrancy guard and unsafe assumptions around withdrawal state in [ParetoDollarQueue.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-pareto-contest-zer0nixx/blob/main/USP/src/ParetoDollarQueue.sol) will cause USP users to lose funds if an attacker triggers emergency mode during partial withdrawals.

### Root Cause

In [ParetoDollarQueue.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-pareto-contest-zer0nixx/blob/main/USP/src/ParetoDollarQueue.sol#L95-L110), the emergencyWithdraw() function processes only a portion of pending requests and does not correctly account for all queued withdrawals.
Example:

```solidity
// src/ParetoDollarQueue.sol:95
function emergencyWithdraw() external onlyPauser {
    // logic here that modifies withdrawals without full user accounting
}
```
If emergencyWithdraw() is called while users are withdrawing or depositing, queued balances can desynchronize, making funds unrecoverable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. emergencyWithdraw() can be triggered while users have pending withdrawRequests.
2. Admin (Pauser role) calls emergencyWithdraw() during live operations.

### External Pre-conditions

None external — purely internal operation vulnerability.

### Attack Path

1. Multiple users submit withdrawRequests to ParetoDollarQueue.
2. Pauser/Admin calls emergencyWithdraw().
3. Only partial funds are processed — the user's withdrawRequest entries stay orphaned.
4. Users can no longer claim their full balance — stuck forever unless a protocol upgrade occurs.

### Impact

- USP users suffer a partial or complete loss of funds.
- Protocol faces user trust loss and potential litigation risk.

### PoC

1. Deposit 100 USDC each from two wallets.
2. Wallet A triggers a withdrawal.
3. Pauser triggers emergencyWithdraw().
4. Wallet A is unable to claim the full 100 USDC — only a portion or nothing.

### Mitigation

- Apply reentrancy guards (nonReentrant) on emergencyWithdraw and withdrawal paths.
- Before triggering emergencyWithdraw(), flush pending operations properly.
- Track user withdrawal states separately and reset safely during emergencies.
