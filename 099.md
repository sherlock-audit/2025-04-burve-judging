# No validation for expired timestamp

## Summary
Modifications are precommitted with a bytes entry and a usage id. The usage id is what specific parts of the contract use to fetch the releveant modifications for themselves. They decode the bytes entry with their expected type and use the values as they see fit. However no validation for past timestamp.

## Vulnerability Details
```solididty
    function precommit(
        PreCommits storage s,
        uint256 useId,
        bytes calldata _entry
    ) internal {
        TimedEntry storage entry = s.entries[useId];
        if (entry.timestamp != 0) revert ExistingPrecommitFound(useId);
        entry.timestamp = uint64(block.timestamp);
        entry.submitter = msg.sender;
        entry.entry = _entry;

        emit PreCommit(useId, msg.sender, _entry);
    }
```
This function helps to submit time gated changes, however validation is only done for 0 timestamps without verifying for outdated timestamps.
## Impact
Incorrect timing of gated changes
## Recommended Mitigation
check for outdated timestammps
