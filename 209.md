# Double-Counting in queryValueIsland Fee Calculation

### Summary

The inclusion of the island contract’s full token balance in the `queryValueIsland` function, without excluding tokens already accounted for in the liquidity position or uncollected fees, will cause incorrect value reporting for users as an attacker will manipulate the island contract’s balance or pool state to inflate reported position values, misleading users  into making erroneous financial decisions.

### Root Cause

The `queryValueIsland` function calculates a user’s share of the island’s value by summing accumulated fees (fees0, fees1), computed via `FeeLib.viewAccumulatedFees`, with the island contract’s token balances `(token0.balanceOf(address(island))`, `token1.balanceOf(address(island))`) minus the manager’s balance (island.managerBalance0(), island.managerBalance1()). However, this calculation double-counts tokens in two ways:


Liquidity Position Tokens: Tokens represented by the island’s active liquidity position (calculated via `getAmountsForLiquidity`) are included in both the liquidity portion of query0/query1 and the `token0.balanceOf(address(island))` term, as the latter may reflect tokens held for the position.

Uncollected Fees: Fees already accounted for in fees0/fees1 (via tokensOwed0/tokensOwed1 from the Uniswap V3 pool) may also be included in the island contract’s balance if the island contract has collected these fees internally, leading to overlap.

This double-counting inflates the reported value of a user’s position, which is particularly problematic for off-chain queries used by user interfaces, pricing oracles, or automated DeFi protocols.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract owner needs to deploy the Burve contract with an island configured (i.e., _island != address(0)) to enable `queryValueIsland` calculations.


`totalIslandShare`s needs to be greater than 0 to indicate active island liquidity in the island contract.


islandrosa for the queried user needs to be greater than 0 to return non-zero values from `queryValueIsland`.



### External Pre-conditions

The island contract needs to hold tokens in its balance that overlap with either the active liquidity position or uncollected fees in the Uniswap V3 pool (e.g., due to internal fee collection, pending withdrawals, or manager fee accruals).

The island contract’s managerBalance0() or managerBalance1() needs to be less than the total token balance to ensure the subtraction does not fully offset the double-counted tokens.

### Attack Path

An attacker identifies or deploys a Burve contract with an island configured, ensuring the island contract holds a significant token balance (e.g., by inducing high trading volume in the Uniswap V3 pool to accumulate fees or directly transferring tokens to the island contract if permitted).


The attacker triggers fee accumulation in the Uniswap V3 pool by executing large swaps, increasing tokensOwed0/tokensOwed1 for the island’s position, which are reflected in fees0/fees1 via FeeLib.viewAccumulatedFees.



The attacker calls `queryValueIsland` for a target user’s address (or induces the user to query their position). The function calculates query0/query1, double-counting tokens by adding token0.balanceOf(address(island)) (e.g., 100 tokens, including 50 from the liquidity position and 20 from fees) to fees0 (e.g., 20 tokens from tokensOwed0).


The inflated values (e.g., 12 tokens instead of 7 for query0) are returned to the user or an off-chain system.

The user or system acts on the inflated values, for example:



The user sells their position at an inflated price in a secondary market, leading to a loss when the true value is realized.

An automated protocol overestimates the user’s collateral, allowing over-borrowing, which could trigger liquidations when the true value is corrected.


The attacker profits indirectly by:


Buying the user’s position at a discount after the inflated sale fails.



Exploiting the over-borrowed collateral in a lending protocol to trigger liquidations and claim liquidation fees.

### Impact

The users suffer incorrect value reporting, leading to potential financial losses if they or off-chain systems act on inflated position values. The approximate error depends on the island contract’s token balance and could range from 5-20% of the position’s value (e.g., if the island holds 100 tokens and 50 are double-counted, the error is 50/500 = 10% for a 500-token position). 

### PoC

A Burve contract is deployed with an island contract managing a Uniswap V3 position in a USDC/WETH pool (assume token0 = USDC, token1 = WETH for simplicity).

The island position has 1000 liquidity units, valued at 500 USDC (based on the current pool price and `getAmountsForLiquidity)`.


The position has accumulated 20 USDC in uncollected fees (tokensOwed0), tracked by the Uniswap V3 pool.

The island contract’s balance is 100 USDC, consisting of:



50 USDC tied to the liquidity position (already accounted for in `getAmountsForLiquidity`).



20 USDC from previously collected fees (overlapping with tokensOwed0).



30 USDC from miscellaneous sources (e.g., pending withdrawals or external transfers).



A user, Alice, holds 100 island shares out of a total supply of 1000 (10% of the position).



The island contract’s managerBalance0 is 0 (no manager fees).

Theoretical Steps





Attacker Increases Island Balance: The attacker, Bob, induces high trading volume in the USDC/WETH pool by executing large swaps (e.g., swapping 10 WETH for USDC). This generates additional fees for the island position, increasing tokensOwed0 to 20 USDC. Alternatively, if the island contract allows external transfers, Bob sends 30 USDC to the island contract to inflate its balance to 100 USDC (50 liquidity + 20 fees + 30 misc).



Alice Queries Position Value: Alice, unaware of the manipulation, queries her position value by calling queryValueIsland(100) through a front-end interface. The function executes as follows:





Liquidity Portion: getAmountsForLiquidity calculates the USDC value of Alice’s 10% share of the 1000 liquidity units, yielding 50 USDC (500 * 100/1000).



Fee Portion: FeeLib.viewAccumulatedFees returns fees0 = 20 USDC (from tokensOwed0). The function then adds token0.balanceOf(address(island)) = 100 USDC and subtracts managerBalance0 = 0, resulting in 20 + 100 - 0 = 120 USDC. Alice’s share is 120 * 100/1000 = 12 USDC.



Total Reported Value: query0 = 50 (liquidity) + 12 (fees) = 62 USDC.



Correct Value Calculation: The correct value should exclude the double-counted tokens:





Liquidity: 50 USDC (as above).



Fees: Only the 20 USDC from tokensOwed0, with Alice’s share being 20 * 100/1000 = 2 USDC. The 100 USDC in the island balance includes 50 USDC (liquidity) and 20 USDC (fees), which are already counted, leaving 30 USDC (miscellaneous) that could be included, but let’s assume only fees are relevant for simplicity.



Correct Total: 50 + 2 = 52 USDC.



Error: 62 - 52 = 10 USDC (19.23% overreporting).



Misleading Action: Alice’s front-end displays her position as worth 62 USDC. She lists her 100 island shares for sale on a secondary market at 62 USDC, expecting to break even. However, buyers, using a more accurate valuation tool, offer only 52 USDC, causing Alice to either sell at a loss or fail to find a buyer.



Attacker’s Profit: Bob, anticipating this, buys Alice’s shares at a discounted 52 USDC (or lower if the market corrects further). Later, when the true value is realized (e.g., during a burn, which correctly distributes only 52 USDC), Bob claims the full 52 USDC, breaking even or profiting if he secures a deeper discount. Alternatively, Bob uses the inflated value in a lending protocol, posting Alice’s position as collateral valued at 62 USDC, borrowing 50 USDC, and defaulting, causing the protocol to liquidate the position at a loss.



Broader Impact: The inflated values propagate to a pricing oracle used by other DeFi protocols, causing mispricing of Burve positions across the ecosystem. This leads to over-borrowing, failed trades, or liquidations, disrupting the Burve contract’s reliability and user trust.

Expected Outcome





Reported Value: 62 USDC (50 liquidity + 12 fees, with 70 USDC double-counted from the island balance).



Correct Value: 52 USDC (50 liquidity + 2 fees).



Error: 10 USDC (19.23% overreporting), sufficient to mislead users or systems.



Attacker’s Gain: 0-10 USDC per exploited position (e.g., buying at 52 USDC and claiming 52 USDC, or profiting from liquidations), with potential for larger systemic disruption via griefing.

### Mitigation

To address the double-counting, modify queryValueIsland to exclude tokens already accounted for in the liquidity position and uncollected fees. A conceptual approach includes:




Subtract the liquidity position tokens (from getAmountsForLiquidity) and uncollected fees (from tokensOwed0/tokensOwed1) from the island contract’s balance before including it in the fee calculation.
