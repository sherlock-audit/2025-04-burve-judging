# Division By Zero in E4626 Share Calculation Can Permanently Brick Vault Deposits

## Summary
The `deposit` function in the VaultE4626Impl library contains a critical division by zero vulnerability that can occur when `totalAssets` is zero but `discountedAmount` is non-zero. This deterministic bug will cause transactions to revert, potentially blocking critical protocol operations like deposits into empty vaults, and could lead to permanent loss of funds in certain scenarios.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `deposit` function of the VaultE4626Impl library, there is a calculation that computes new shares based on the ratio of the deposited amount to the total assets. However, there's a logical flaw in the conditional check that's supposed to handle the case when `totalAssets` is zero.

From `src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L104-L128:

```solidity
function deposit(
    VaultE4626 storage self,
    VaultTemp memory temp,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    uint256 newlyAdding = FullMath.mulX128(
        temp.vars[1],
        temp.vars[3],
        true // Round up to round shares down.
    );
    uint256 totalAssets = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding - temp.vars[2];

    uint256 discountedAmount = FullMath.mulX128(
        amount,
        temp.vars[3],
        false // Round down to round shares down.
    );
    uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
        ? discountedAmount
        : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
    self.shares[cid] += newShares;
    self.totalShares += newShares;
    temp.vars[1] += amount;
}
```

The issue is in the conditional expression:

```solidity
uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
    ? discountedAmount
    : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
```

When `totalAssets` is zero, the function sets `newShares` to `discountedAmount`. However, this logic assumes that if `totalAssets` is zero, then `self.totalShares` must also be zero. But there's no guarantee that this is always the case.

If `totalAssets` becomes zero (due to losses in the underlying vault or rounding errors) while `self.totalShares` is still non-zero, the function will bypass the division by zero check and attempt to execute `FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets)`, which will revert due to division by zero.

Additionally, there's a potential issue with the calculation of `totalAssets`. If `temp.vars[2]` (representing assets to withdraw) is greater than `temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding` (representing current assets plus assets being added), then `totalAssets` will underflow, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Transaction Failures**: Any deposit transaction will revert if `totalAssets` is zero but `self.totalShares` is non-zero, preventing users from depositing into the vault.

2. **Denial of Service**: Critical operations like adding liquidity or migrating to a new vault may fail if they involve deposits into a vault with zero assets but non-zero shares.

3. **Permanent Fund Loss**: If users are unable to deposit into a vault due to this issue, they may be forced to use other, less optimal paths, potentially leading to financial losses.

4. **Protocol Instability**: The inconsistent state between assets and shares can lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol, potentially affecting other operations.

5. **Protocol Death Spiral**: Vaults that receive slashed, stolen, or devalued underlying assets can become "bricked" for deposits, freezing LP onboarding and capital flows. This can trigger a protocol death spiral as users lose confidence and withdraw remaining funds, further exacerbating the issue.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur under specific conditions
- It directly affects core protocol functionality (deposits into vaults)
- It can lead to transaction failures and potential fund loss
- It has no workaround once the condition is met

## Proof of Concept
Consider the following scenario:

1. A vault has some assets and shares (e.g., `totalAssets = 100`, `self.totalShares = 100`).
2. Due to losses in the underlying vault or rounding errors, `totalAssets` becomes 0, but `self.totalShares` remains 100.
3. A user attempts to deposit into the vault with `amount = 100`.
4. The `deposit` function calculates `totalAssets` as 0.
5. The function calculates `discountedAmount = 100` (assuming `temp.vars[3]` is approximately 1 << 128).
6. Since `totalAssets` is 0, the function should set `newShares` to `discountedAmount`.
7. However, due to the logical flaw, the function attempts to execute:
   ```solidity
   FullMath.mulDiv(100, 100, 0) // self.totalShares = 100, discountedAmount = 100, totalAssets = 0
   ```
8. This operation reverts due to division by zero, making the deposit transaction fail.

This scenario is not theoretical - it's a realistic sequence of operations that could occur in a vault with losses or rounding errors. In fact, it's eventually inevitable in DeFi systems where underlying assets can be slashed, stolen, or devalued.

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the incorrect assumption that if `totalAssets` is zero, then `self.totalShares` must also be zero. This assumption is not always valid, especially in cases where the underlying vault has experienced losses or there are rounding errors in the calculations.

## Code Snippet
From `src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L104-L128:

```solidity
function deposit(
    VaultE4626 storage self,
    VaultTemp memory temp,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    uint256 newlyAdding = FullMath.mulX128(
        temp.vars[1],
        temp.vars[3],
        true // Round up to round shares down.
    );
    uint256 totalAssets = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding - temp.vars[2];

    uint256 discountedAmount = FullMath.mulX128(
        amount,
        temp.vars[3],
        false // Round down to round shares down.
    );
    uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
        ? discountedAmount
        : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
    self.shares[cid] += newShares;
    self.totalShares += newShares;
    temp.vars[1] += amount;
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several approaches to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Check for Zero Total Shares**: Modify the conditional expression to check both `totalAssets` and `self.totalShares`:

```solidity
uint256 newShares = (totalAssets == 0 || self.totalShares == 0)
    ? discountedAmount
    : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
```

2. **Prevent Underflow in Total Assets Calculation**: Add a check to ensure that `temp.vars[2]` is not greater than `temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding`:

```solidity
uint256 assetsBeforeWithdrawal = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding;
uint256 totalAssets = assetsBeforeWithdrawal >= temp.vars[2]
    ? assetsBeforeWithdrawal - temp.vars[2]
    : 0;
```

3. **Reset Shares When Assets Become Zero**: Implement a mechanism to reset `self.totalShares` to zero when `totalAssets` becomes zero:

```solidity
if (totalAssets == 0 && self.totalShares > 0) {
    self.totalShares = 0;
    // Reset individual shares as well
    // This would require iterating through all closures with shares
}
```

**Note**: This approach carries significant risks. Resetting shares when assets drop to zero could create fairness issues and potentially require pausing the system to carefully reinitialize shares. This should only be considered with extreme caution and proper governance approval, as it effectively redistributes ownership within the vault.

Option 1 is the simplest and most direct fix, as it addresses the immediate issue without requiring complex changes to the protocol's logic.
