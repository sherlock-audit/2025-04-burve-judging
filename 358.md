# Rewards earned when all values are `unstaked` are permanently locked in the Reserve

# Summary
When all values are `unstaked` from a closure (i.e., bgtValueStaked becomes zero while `valueStaked` retains its initial value set by the protocol), any new rewards added via `addEarnings` become permanently unclaimable in the reserve. This happens because the protocol still computes a share value for the non-BGT portion of the rewards using a small non-zero initialized denominator, but no user has any value staked to claim it.

# Lines of Code affected
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L662C1-L704C1

# Vulnerability Detail
In the following code: 
```solidity
self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] +=
    (reserveShares << 128) / (self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked);
```
This line silently executes even when `bgtValueStaked` is zero and no users are staking values. It avoids a division-by-zero because the protocol pre-initializes `valueStaked` with a small non-zero value, but in this state, there are no value stakers left to claim rewards. As a result, the `reserveShares` deposited are tracked in the accounting system but become permanently inaccessible â€” stuck in the reserve.

# Impact
Earnings are silently lost when no users have values staked and the volume can be high since the closures still remains operational in this setting

# Tool Used
Manual Review

# Recommendation
Add an explicit check to perform different handling of accounting when `valueStaked== initialValueDeposited` or track these earnings separately to evenly redistribute later when users re-enter the pool with value stakes.
