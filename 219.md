# Attacker can steal user funds via ERC4626 inflation attack on underlying vault

### Summary

The `VaultE4626` contract wraps an underlying ERC4626 vault but lacks mitigations against the standard [ERC4626](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L15) inflation attack. An attacker can exploit the underlying vault directly to manipulate its asset-to-share ratio. When users subsequently deposit into the `VaultE4626` wrapper, the wrapper reads the manipulated asset value from the underlying vault (`previewRedeem`) for its own share calculation. This leads to the victim receiving significantly fewer wrapper shares than their deposit warrants, allowing the attacker to profit by withdrawing their small initial share for a disproportionately large amount of assets, including the victim's funds.


### Root Cause

The wrapper's `deposit` function calculates shares using `totalAssets` from the underlying vault (`temp.vars[0]` via `previewRedeem`). It doesn't mitigate against this value being artificially inflated by direct asset transfers to the underlying vault. The formula `FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets)` uses this potentially inflated `totalAssets`, causing incorrect share issuance.


### Internal Pre-conditions

*   A `VaultE4626` wrapper instance exists, linked to an underlying `IERC4626` vault.
*   The underlying vault is susceptible to the inflation attack (e.g., initial 1 wei deposit yields 1 share, direct asset transfers inflate assets).
*   `self.totalShares` in the wrapper is non-zero (or the attacker makes the first deposit).


### External Pre-conditions

*   Attacker can interact with both the wrapper and the underlying vault contracts.
*   Attacker possesses and can transfer the underlying asset tokens.

### Attack Path

1.  Identify a `VaultE4626` instance and its underlying `IERC4626` vault.
2.  Deposit a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei) into the *underlying vault* directly, receiving minimal underlying shares (e.g., 1). (Alternatively, if the wrapper is empty, deposit 1 wei via the wrapper, causing it to deposit into the underlying vault).
3.  Directly transfer a large amount (`X`) of the underlying asset to the *underlying vault contract address*. This increases `totalAssets` in the underlying vault without changing its `totalSupply`.
4.  A victim calls `deposit` on the *wrapper contract* with a substantial amount (`Y`).
5.  The wrapper's `fetch` calls `previewRedeem` on the underlying vault, getting the inflated asset value (`temp.vars[0]` â‰ˆ `X`).
6.  The wrapper's `deposit` calculates `newShares` for the victim using the inflated `totalAssets`: `newShares = FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, Y, X)`. Due to `X >> Y`, `newShares` likely rounds down to 0. The victim receives 0 wrapper shares.
7.  The wrapper's `commit` deposits the victim's `Y` assets into the underlying vault.
8.  Attacker withdraws their minimal deposit (from the underlying vault or via the wrapper). Due to the inflated asset-to-share ratio, they receive their initial deposit plus a large portion of the victim's `Y` funds.

### Impact

Loss of funds for users depositing into the `VaultE4626` wrapper following an inflation attack on the underlying vault. Victims receive zero or drastically fewer shares than entitled, while the attacker extracts value, including the victim's deposit, by redeeming their initially small shareholding.
