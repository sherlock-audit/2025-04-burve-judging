# `VaultProxyImpl.withdraw` Reverts When Backup Vault is Missing and Active Vault is Insufficient

### Summary

The `withdraw` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L121) within the `VaultProxyImpl` library is designed to withdraw funds first from the `active` vault pointer and then from the `backup` vault pointer if the requested `amount` exceeds the `available` balance in the `active` vault. However, the function does not check if the `backup` vault pointer is valid (i.e., points to an actual vault rather than being zeroed) before attempting the withdrawal call on `self.backup`.


### Root Cause

1.  `VaultProxy` structs are created in memory by `VaultLib.getProxy`.
2.  `VaultLib.getProxy` correctly avoids fetching and assigning a `VaultPointer` to `vProxy.backup` if no backup vault address is registered for the given `VertexId` in storage (`Store.vaults().backups[vid] == address(0)`). In this case, `vProxy.backup` remains a default, zeroed `VaultPointer` struct.
3.  `VaultProxyImpl.withdraw` receives this `vProxy` struct.
4.  If the withdrawal `amount` is greater than the `available` balance in `self.active`, the code proceeds to call `self.active.withdraw(cid, available)` followed immediately by `self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available)`.
5.  There is no check preceding the call to `self.backup.withdraw` to verify if `self.backup` actually represents a configured vault (e.g., by checking `self.backup.vType` or another non-zero field).
6.  Calling a function (specifically `withdraw`) on a zeroed `VaultPointer` struct leads to interacting with zero addresses or storage slots, causing the transaction to revert.


### Internal Pre-conditions

If a vertex only has an active vault configured (no backup) and a withdrawal is requested for an amount greater than the balance available in that active vault, the transaction will revert unexpectedly within `VaultProxyImpl.withdraw`. 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

This affects:

*   Direct withdrawals via `Vertex.withdraw`.
*   Automated balance adjustments via `Vertex.trimBalance`.
*   Reserve withdrawals via `ReserveLib.withdraw`.
*   Any higher-level function calling these (e.g., in `SwapFacet`, `ValueFacet`).

This constitutes a Denial of Service (DoS) for withdrawals under these specific conditions (no backup vault + withdrawal amount > active vault balance). It prevents the withdrawal of even the available funds from the active vault because the revert happens *after* the active vault withdrawal attempt but before the transaction completes.
