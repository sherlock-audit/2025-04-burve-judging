# Mismatch Between Island Shares and Total Shares Will Prevent Liquidity Withdrawal

### Summary


Because mintIsland awards island shares based on per-range liquidity (liqInRange) which iis different from the Burve  LP token shares calculated in mint, there will be a misalignment between islandSharesPerOwner and balanceOf(recipient). This root cause will lead to a denial-of-service for liquidity providers, as when they later call burn, the contract may compute islandBurnShares as zero—leaving validly specified shares permanently unredeemable.



### Root Cause

1. In  Burn () function the amount of share specified to be burned is first burnt from the Island at index 0 
2. The amount of shares minted to  a user on adding liquidity are both the IslandShare(when it is used in distx96) and the Burve share This result in the user burning from the Island share 



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The Burve pool contains both the Kodiak Island and the Uniswap position assigned by the distx96 
2. when minting it mints both Island token and burve token to   reciepient 
3. Total share representing the liquidity of  the reciepient is given by `` IslandShare + Burve share ``


### External Pre-conditions

1. when the user wants to burn an amount of their share that is less than their  ``TotalShare  i.e equivalent of IslandShare + BurveShare``  But this amount is more than their IslandShare  The token uses the island share and if the amount is greater than the island share it returns 0

1. User calls mint(...); mintIsland credits mintShares island shares, and mint credits shares LP tokens.
2. Time passes or ranges change—ratios drift.
3. User calls burn(shares, …)
4. In burnIsland,:
  
```solidity
islandBurnShares = FullMath.mulDiv(
  islandSharesPerOwner[msg.sender],
  shares,
  balanceOf(msg.sender)
);
//Evaluates to 0 because mintShares / shares ≠ islandSharesPerOwner / balanceOf.


```
5. No Island liquidity is returned, though LP tokens are burned.






### Impact

Liquidity Providers cannot withdraw their allocated funds, experiencing a denial-of-service on that portion of their position. Because he amount of share which the user specify to burn might be more than the Island share allocated to them but the logic burns from the island using a share amount of the burve share 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include  a getter function to compute the liquidity amount to burn using the balance  of IslandShare and Burve share while calculating the amount to burn from a user position
