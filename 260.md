# Incorrect Handling of Compound Liquidity in collectAndCalcCompound function

### Summary

The arbitrary subtraction of liquidity in `collectAndCalcCompound` will cause a permanent lock of uncompounded fees for the contract as the function returns zero liquidity due to over-subtraction, preventing fee compounding and reducing user returns.

### Root Cause

In Burve.sol, `collectAndCalcCompound` subtracts 2 * distX96.length from mintNominalLiq to account for potential rounding errors:

```solidity

mintNominalLiq = mintNominalLiq <= (2 * distX96.length)
    ? 0
    : mintNominalLiq - uint128(2 * distX96.length);


```

This subtraction is arbitrary and does not reflect actual rounding errors, which depend on distX96[i] and liquidity calculations. If mintNominalLiq is reduced to 0, compoundV3Ranges  returns early:

```solidity

uint128 compoundedNominalLiq = collectAndCalcCompound();
if (compoundedNominalLiq == 0) {
    return;
}

```

This prevents compounding of accumulated fees, leaving them on the contract indefinitely, as subsequent calls repeat the same logic.

### Internal Pre-conditions

the contract needs to have accumulated fees in token0 or token1 to be at least 1000 wei to trigger compounding attempts.


The calculated `mintNominalLiq` in `collectAndCalcCompound` needs to be at most 2 * distX96.length (e.g., due to small fee amounts or many ranges).


The number of ranges (distX96.length) needs to be at least 5 to increase the likelihood of` mintNominalLiq` being zeroed out.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The contract accumulates 1000 wei of fees in token0 from Uniswap V3 positions over time.

A user calls mint or burn, triggering compoundV3Ranges to compound fees.

`collectAndCalcCompound` calculates `mintNominalLiq` as 10 units based on fee amounts and range weights.

With distX96.length = 5, mintNominalLiq is reduced to 10 - 2 * 5 = 0.

compoundV3Ranges returns early, leaving the 1000 wei uncompounded on the contract.

Subsequent mint or burn calls repeat this process, as the uncompounded fees remain and `mintNominalLiq` is consistently zeroed out.


The fees are effectively locked, never reinvested into liquidity positions.

### Impact

The contract suffers an inability to compound fees, resulting in an approximate loss of 100% of accumulated feesâ€™ potential returns. Users experience reduced returns, as fees are not reinvested to generate additional liquidity or fees.

### PoC

Deploy the Burve contract with a mock Uniswap V3 pool and five ranges (distX96.length = 5), each with equal weights.

Simulate fee accumulation by transferring 1000 wei of token0 to the contract (mimicking fees collected from Uniswap V3).

Call mint(Alice, 1000, 0, type(uint160).max) to trigger compoundV3Ranges.

Observe the `totalNominalLiq` and token0 balance of the contract before and after the call.

Expected result: `totalNominalLiq` increases by approximately 10 units (proportional to fees), and token0 balance decreases as fees are compounded.

Actual result: `totalNominalLiq` remains unchanged, and token0 balance remains at 1000 wei, confirming that fees are not compounded due to the early return.

Repeat the mint call to verify that fees remain locked across multiple attempts.


### Mitigation

Remove Arbitrary Subtraction: Eliminate the 2 * distX96.length subtraction and calculate actual rounding errors based on distX96[i] and liquidity requirements for each range.


Handle Residual Fees: Track uncompounded fees in a separate state variable and attempt to compound them in future calls, ensuring small fee amounts are not lost.

```solidity

function collectAndCalcCompound() internal returns (uint128 mintNominalLiq) {
    // ... existing logic up to nominalLiq0 and nominalLiq1 ...
    mintNominalLiq = unsafeNominalLiq > type(uint128).max ? type(uint128).max : uint128(unsafeNominalLiq);
    // Ensure minimum liquidity to avoid deadlock
    if (mintNominalLiq == 0 && (collected0 > 0 || collected1 > 0)) {
        mintNominalLiq = 1; // Minimum unit to allow compounding
    }
    // Track residual fees if necessary
}
