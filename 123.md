# The accumulatedFee is incorrectly adjusted in the `Burve::queryValueV3Ranges`

### Summary

The `accumulatedFee` was incorrectly reduced by the deduction of the `distX96.length` range.

### Root Cause

The `queryValue` queries the token amounts in a user's position.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L462
```javascript
function queryValue(
        address owner
    ) external view returns (uint256 query0, uint256 query1) {
        // calculate amounts owned in v3 ranges
        uint256 shares = balanceOf(owner);
>>>.       (query0, query1) = queryValueV3Ranges(shares);

        // calculate amounts owned by island position
        uint256 ownerIslandShares = islandSharesPerOwner[owner];
        (uint256 island0, uint256 island1) = queryValueIsland(
            ownerIslandShares
        );
        query0 += island0;
        query1 += island1;
    }
```
The function then calls the `queryValueV3Ranges` which in turn makes the deduction ranges from the `accumulatedFees` this logic flaws the operation by deducting the ranges from the `accumulatedFees`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L663
```javascript
        // matches collected amount adjustment in collectAndCalcCompound
        if (accumulatedFees0 > distX96.length) { 
>>>     accumulatedFees0 -= distX96.length;
        } else {
            accumulatedFees0 = 0;
        }

        if (accumulatedFees1 > distX96.length) {
>>>.  accumulatedFees1 -= distX96.length;
        } else {
            accumulatedFees1 = 0;
        }
```
This approach leads to undercounting of fees that should belong to users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The internal precondition is the `queryValueV3Ranges`

### External Pre-conditions

The external function called is the `queryValue` which takes the address of `owner` and inturns calls the internal function `queryValueV3Ranges`

### Attack Path

What the code basically does is when the `accumulateFees` is gotten from the `getAmountFromLiquidity` and the `compoundFees` are added the the code moves to the `if` statement:
```javascript
 if (accumulatedFees0 > distX96.length) { 
            accumulatedFees0 -= distX96.length;
        } else {
            accumulatedFees0 = 0;
        }

        if (accumulatedFees1 > distX96.length) {
            accumulatedFees1 -= distX96.length;
        } else {
            accumulatedFees1 = 0;
        }
```
it first checks if the `accumulatedFees` are greater than the `distX96.length` it then proceed to deduct the `distX96.length` from the `accumulatedFees` (the affected code)

Assume a scenario where the; `accumulatedFees` = 5wei and the `distX96.length` =  2 (ranges), then the substraction equals to 3wei(The user incorrectly losing 3 wei).

### Impact

High: Fee loss 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The affected code should be removed or the condition to be redesign
