# Tokens get lost during `trimBalance`

### Summary

In multi-token protocol, whenever there happens an action, trimming process is triggered where profits from LSTs are collected and then distributed to users either in form of fees or BGT tokens.

This is processed through [`trimBalance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L60-L84) function of `Vertex` contract, as shown below:

```solidity
    function trimBalance(
        Vertex storage self,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 targetReal,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 bgtValue
    ) internal returns (uint256 reserveSharesEarned, uint256 bgtResidual) {
        VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
        uint256 realBalance = vProxy.balance(cid, false);
        // We don't error and instead emit in this scenario because clearly the vault is not working properly but if
        // we error users can't withdraw funds. Instead the right response is to lock and move vaults immediately.
        if (targetReal > realBalance) {
            emit InsufficientBalance(self.vid, cid, targetReal, realBalance);
            return (0, 0);
        }
        uint256 residualReal = realBalance - targetReal;
        vProxy.withdraw(cid, residualReal);
        bgtResidual = FullMath.mulDiv(residualReal, bgtValue, value);
        reserveSharesEarned = ReserveLib.deposit(
            vProxy,
            self.vid,
            residualReal - bgtResidual
        );
        vProxy.commit();
    }
```

As shown above, `residualReal` amount gets withdrawn from specific `cid` and then deposited into the reserve.

Within current implementation of `ERC4626` vault management, actual vault actions are deferred until `commit` function is called, to reduce the number of external calls.

However, when the `ERC4626` vault charges `fee`, the shares for reserve gets deducted while there happens no actions with the vault.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue happens because the [`deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L104-L128) function of `E4626.sol` always assumes that the deposit amounts should get taxed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

One of vertices is a LST that is associated with `ERC4626` vault with `fee` charged.

### External Pre-conditions

LST price goes up that generates profits.

### Attack Path

- `stETH` is one of tokens, `1 stETH = 1.1 ETH`, `100 stETH` is deposited to the pool.
- Assume, the associated `ERC4626` vault charges `1%` fee.
- After a while, `stETH` price goes up and `100 stETH` is now `120 stETH`.
- As 10 ETH worth of value is added to the pool, so 10 ETH worth of `stETH` is withdrawn from the pool and deposited into the reserve.
- Assuming BGT staked value is 0, the all amount of withdrawn `stETH` is deposited into the reserve, which at the ends makes no difference in the total shares in the vault.
- However, as the vault charges `1%` fee, 0.1 ETH worth of `stETH` gets stuck in the vault and shares amount gets reduced.

### Impact

Loss of tokens for users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

During `trimBalance`, the amount of deposit can't exceed the amount of withdrawal, so the deposits shouldn't be taxed.

This can be fixed by adding a flag to `deposit` function to indicate that the deposit should be taxed or not.
