# Native tokens sent to the Diamond contract are locked without a built-in recovery mechanism

### Summary

The lack of a native token recovery mechanism in the Diamond contract will cause temporary locking of user funds when they accidentally send native tokens (BERA/ETH/etc.) to the contract address

### Root Cause

In `Diamond.sol:239` there is an empty [`receive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L238) function that allows the contract to receive native tokens (BERA/ETH/etc.) but there is no built-in mechanism to handle or recover these tokens without a contract upgrade

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The Diamond contract has an empty `receive()` function that allows it to accept native tokens
2. The protocol exclusively uses ERC20 tokens for all operations (not native tokens)
3. There is no built-in mechanism to withdraw or recover native tokens sent to the contract
4. Recovery is only possible through a contract upgrade process (adding a withdrawal facet)

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol will be deployed on multiple chains with different native tokens (Berachain, Monad, Base, Avalanche, HyperLiquid L1, BSC, Arbitrum)
2. Users might not be aware that the protocol doesn't handle native tokens

### Attack Path

1. A user sends native tokens (BERA/ETH/AVAX/etc.) to the Diamond contract address
2. The contract's `receive()` function accepts these tokens
3. The tokens are now locked in the contract with no direct way for the user to recover them
4. The protocol has no built-in function to withdraw or recover these tokens
5. Recovery would require a governance action to add a withdrawal facet through the Diamond upgrade mechanism

### Impact

Users who accidentally send native tokens (BERA, ETH, AVAX, etc.) to the Diamond contract will have their funds locked until a contract upgrade is performed. The loss amount could be significant depending on the amount of native tokens sent, and recovery is dependent on protocol governance action. This represents a temporary but potentially long-term loss of user funds, as there is no built-in recovery mechanism that users can directly access.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement one of the following solutions:

1. **Remove the `receive()` function** to prevent the contract from accepting native tokens altogether

2. **Add a built-in recovery mechanism** by including a withdrawal facet in the initial diamond deployment:

```solidity
        // Create a WithdrawalFacet
        contract WithdrawalFacet {
            function recoverETH(address recipient, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
                (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: amount}("");
                require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
            }
        }

        // Add it to the diamond during initialization
        bytes4[] memory withdrawalSelectors = new bytes4[](1);
        withdrawalSelectors[0] = WithdrawalFacet.recoverETH.selector;
        cuts[9] = IDiamond.FacetCut({
            facetAddress: address(new WithdrawalFacet()),
            action: IDiamond.FacetCutAction.Add,
            functionSelectors: withdrawalSelectors
        });
```

3. **Implement automatic wrapping** to convert received native tokens to their wrapped versions:

```solidity
        receive() external payable {
            // Convert to WETH/WBERA/etc.
            IWETH(wethAddress).deposit{value: msg.value}();
            // Update internal accounting
        }
 ```
