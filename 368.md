# Incorrect Variable Used for Tax Calculation in removeValueSingle function

### Summary

The function `removeValueSingle` incorrectly uses an uninitialized variable (`removedBalance`) in the tax calculation, leading to incorrect tax deductions and loss of tax fees.

### Root Cause

The variable `removedBalance` is used in the calculation of `realTax` before it is assigned a value. The correct variable to use in that context is `realRemoved`, which represents the total real value removed including taxes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. baseFeeX128 is set

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `removeValueSingle` with valid parameters.
2. Due to the incorrect usage of `removedBalance` before assignment, the `realTax` is 0.

### Impact

**Loss of Fees/Tax**

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the incorrect use of `removedBalance `with `realRemoved `in the tax calculation:

```diff
- uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
-           removedBalance,
-            nominalTax,
-            removedNominal
-        );

+ uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
+    realRemoved, // Correct usage
+    nominalTax,
+    removedNominal
+);


```
