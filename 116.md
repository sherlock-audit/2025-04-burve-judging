# No function to swap BGT back to `inTokens`

## Summary
The `exchange` function allows user to swap `inToken` for Bgt tokens,  Requests the specified token and amount in exchange for bgt at the set rate. The BGT is not given immediately, instead the caller has a right for which they can withdraw. 
However no function is defined to swap BGT tokens back to  in tokens or other tokens
## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
    function exchange(
        address inToken,
        uint128 amount
    ) external returns (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) {
        if (!isExchanger[msg.sender]) revert NoExchangePermissions();

        (bgtAmount, spendAmount) = viewExchange(inToken, amount);
        if (bgtAmount > 0) {
            bgtBalance -= bgtAmount;
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom( // We take what we need.
                    inToken,
                    msg.sender,
                    address(this),
                    spendAmount
                );
            owed[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
        }
    }
```
As we can see it onlly sawp tokens to BGT , but no way to swap back BGT tokens to other tokens
## Impact
Tokens would be stuck as BGT with no way to swap back
## Recommended Mitigation
Add a mechanism to handle swapping back BGT tokens to inTokens
