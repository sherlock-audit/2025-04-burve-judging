# Insolvency when compounding in `Burve.sol` due to not redepositing all of the compounded liquidity

### Summary

The distribution percentages for each pool are computed during the constructor using the initial `_weights`:

```solidity
uint256 sum = 0;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _weights.length; ++i) {
    sum += _weights[i];
}

// Calculate distribution for each weighted position
for (uint256 i = 0; i < _weights.length; ++i) {
    distX96.push((_weights[i] << 96) / sum);
}
```

In `compoundV3Ranges`, the function internally calls `collectAndCalcCompound`, which itself invokes `getCompoundAmountsPerUnitNominalLiqX64` to determine the amounts per unit of nominal liquidity:

```solidity
function getCompoundAmountsPerUnitNominalLiqX64()
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256 amount0InUnitLiqX64, uint256 amount1InUnitLiqX64)
{
    (uint160 sqrtRatioX96,,,,,,) = pool.slot0();

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
        TickRange memory range = ranges[i];

        // Skip island ranges
        if (range.isIsland()) {
            continue;
        }

        // Calculate token amounts for a unit of liquidity, weighted by distX96
        uint128 liqInRangeX64 = uint128(shift96(uint256(UNIT_NOMINAL_LIQ_X64) * distX96[i], true));

        (uint256 range0InUnitLiqX64, uint256 range1InUnitLiqX64) =
            getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, liqInRangeX64, range.lower, range.upper, true);

        amount0InUnitLiqX64 += range0InUnitLiqX64;
        amount1InUnitLiqX64 += range1InUnitLiqX64;
    }
}
```

Although island pools are skipped in this calculation, the `distX96` used still includes their weights.

Later in `compoundV3Ranges`, while calculating the liquidity to deposit, the island pool is again ignored, but the `distX96` used still contains its original weight:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
    TickRange memory range = memRanges[i];

    // Skip island pools
    if (range.isIsland()) {
        continue;
    }

    //@review - compoundedNominalLiq excludes the island, but distX96 includes it, leading to under-allocation
    uint128 compoundLiq = uint128(shift96(uint256(compoundedNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true));
    compoundLiqs[i] = compoundLiq;

    if (compoundLiq == 0) {
        continue;
    }

    (uint256 mint0, uint256 mint1) =
        getAmountsForLiquidity(sqrtRatioX96, compoundLiq, range.lower, range.upper, true);
    totalMint0 += mint0;
    totalMint1 += mint1;
}
```

Since the island's weight remains in `distX96` but it is excluded in all actual compounding logic, this creates a mismatch: compounded liquidity is overstated while actual minted liquidity is under-deposited.

### Root Cause

The root issue is that `distX96` is never recalculated after excluding island pools. This causes liquidity distributions to be misaligned with actual compounding, especially when islands are present.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- There is at least one pool marked as an island with a non-zero allocation.

### External Pre-conditions

- None.

### Attack Path

1. Three pools exist:
   - Island pool with 30% weight
   - Pool 1 (range 1-10) with 30% weight
   - Pool 2 (range -10 to 10) with 40% weight
2. Pools 1 and 2 are compounded with 2 units of liquidity.
3. Distribution logic still includes island:
   - 30% of 2 = 0.6
   - 40% of 2 = 0.8
4. Since island is skipped in practice, 30% of the expected liquidity is never actually deposited.
5. `totalNominalLiq` is overstated, leading to a loss in solvency and under-allocation of user liquidity.

### Impact

- Users may be **unable to [burn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L361-L383)** their LP tokens ([burn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L361-L383)).
- This creates a scenario of **complete insolvency**, as a portion of totalNominalLiq was never actually compounded into liquidity.

### PoC

_None provided._

### Mitigation

Update the logic to recalculate `distX96` excluding all island pools before any liquidity distribution:

- Filter out all island ranges prior to calculating distribution weights.
- Normalize remaining weights to ensure `distX96` accurately reflects active (compounded) pools.

This ensures proper liquidity alignment and system solvency.
