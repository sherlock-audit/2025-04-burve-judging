# Tax Asymmetry in Burve Protocol

## Description
There is a significant asymmetry in how taxes are applied between deposit and withdrawal operations in the Burve protocol. This asymmetry creates an economic vulnerability that could be exploited by users to minimize their tax burden at the expense of the protocol's liquidity.

The key asymmetry is:

When using `addValue`, no tax is levied at all.
When using `removeValueSingle` or `removeSingleForValue`, tax is levied, but it's taken from the Vertex (the pool) rather than from the user's funds.
This creates an opportunity for optimization: users can deposit funds via addValue (without paying tax), and then withdraw via `removeValueSingle` or `removeSingleForValue`, where the tax is taken from the Vertex rather than from the user's funds. This effectively allows users to avoid paying taxes on their deposits while still receiving the full amount of their withdrawals.

## Proof of Concept
Let's examine the relevant code sections that demonstrate this asymmetry:

Deposit Methods
1. `addValue` (ValueFacet.sol):
- Does not apply any tax
- All tokens are deposited in full amount to the Vertex
```solidity
function addValue(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue
)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory requiredBalances)
{
    // No tax calculation or deduction
    // ...
}
```
2. `addValueSingle` (ValueFacet.sol):
- Applies tax: `uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(requiredBalance, nominalTax, nominalRequired)`
- Tax goes to pool earnings: `c.addEarnings(vid, realTax)`
- Only the amount after tax is deposited: `Store.vertex(vid).deposit(cid, requiredBalance - realTax)`

```solidity
function addValueSingle(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue,
    address token,
    uint128 maxRequired
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 requiredBalance) {
    // ...
    uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
        requiredBalance,
        nominalTax,
        nominalRequired
    );
    // ...
    c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
    Store.vertex(vid).deposit(cid, requiredBalance - realTax);
    // ...
}
```
### Withdrawal Methods
1. `removeValue` (ValueFacet.sol):
- Does not apply any tax
- User receives the full amount
```solidity
function removeValue(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue
)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory receivedBalances)
{
    // No tax calculation or deduction
    // ...
}
```
2. `removeValueSingle` (ValueFacet.sol):
- Applies tax: `uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal)`
- Tax goes to pool earnings: `c.addEarnings(vid, realTax)`
- Full amount is withdrawn from `Vertex: Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false)`
- User receives amount after tax: `removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax`
```solidity
function removeValueSingle(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue,
    address token,
    uint128 minReceive
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 removedBalance) {
    // ...
    Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
    uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
        removedBalance,
        nominalTax,
        removedNominal
    );
    c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
    removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax; // How much the user actually gets.
    // ...
}
```
3. `removeSingleForValue` (ValueFacet.sol):
- Applies tax: `uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(amount, nominalTax, nominalReceive)`
- Tax goes to pool earnings: `c.addEarnings(vid, realTax)`
- Full amount plus tax is withdrawn from `Vertex: Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, amount + realTax, false)`
- User receives the requested amount: `TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, amount)`
```solidity
function removeSingleForValue(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    address token,
    uint128 amount,
    uint256 bgtPercentX256,
    uint128 maxValue
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 valueGiven) {
    // ...
    uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(amount, nominalTax, nominalReceive);
    Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, amount + realTax, false);
    c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, amount);
    // ...
}
```
### Exploitation Scenario
A user can exploit this asymmetry by:

1. Depositing funds using `addValue` (no tax paid)
2. Withdrawing funds using `removeValueSingle` or `removeSingleForValue` (tax taken from the Vertex)
This creates a situation where users can avoid paying taxes on their deposits while still receiving the full amount of their withdrawals, effectively transferring the tax burden to the protocol.

This asymmetry presents several economic vulnerabilities to the protocol:

1. Depletion of Vertex Liquidity: If many users exploit this asymmetry, it could lead to a gradual depletion of liquidity in the Vertices due to constant taxation from the pool's reserves rather than from user funds.
2. Uneven Distribution of Tax Burden: Users who are unaware of this asymmetry may pay more taxes than those who optimize their strategies, creating an unfair advantage for sophisticated users.
3. Economic Imbalance: The protocol's economic model assumes that taxes are paid by users, but this asymmetry allows users to shift the tax burden to the protocol itself, potentially undermining its long-term sustainability.
4. Potential for Abuse: Sophisticated users can create strategies to extract value from the protocol by exploiting this asymmetry, especially through frequent deposits and withdrawals.

## Recommendation
To address this asymmetry, consider implementing one of the following solutions:

1. Consistent Tax Application: Apply taxes consistently across all deposit and withdrawal methods. Either all methods should levy taxes, or none should.
2. Tax Source Consistency: Ensure that taxes are always taken from the same source (either always from user funds or always from the Vertex).
3. Modify `addValue`: Implement tax calculation and collection in the `addValue` function to match the behavior of other deposit methods.
4. Modify Withdrawal Methods: Change the withdrawal methods to take tax from user funds rather than from the Vertex.
The most straightforward solution would be to modify the `addValue` function to apply taxes in the same way as `addValueSingle` and `addSingleForValue`. This would ensure that all deposit methods have consistent tax behavior.

Example implementation for `addValue`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L58-L96

This change would ensure that taxes are consistently applied across all deposit methods, eliminating the economic vulnerability created by the current asymmetry.
