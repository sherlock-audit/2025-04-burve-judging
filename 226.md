# Sub-resolution deposit burns funds & inflates share-price

### Summary

In [ReserveLib.deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Reserve.sol#L31-L48), very small deposits can mint zero vault shares due to integer division, causing the user’s tokens to be locked in the vault while share count remains unchanged. This silently burns their funds and artificially inflates the share price for existing holders

### Root Cause

```solidity
shares = (balance == 0)
    ? amount * SHARE_RESOLUTION
    : (amount * reserve.shares[idx]) / balance;
```
When balance > 0 and
```solidity
amount * reserve.shares[idx] < balance
```
the division yields 0, so the depositor receives zero shares despite transferring amount tokens.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

- The vault must already have a non-zero balance and share count.
- A user deposits an amount smaller than `balance / reserve.shares[idx]`.

### Attack Path

1. Vault has `balance` B and `shares` S from prior LPs.
2. Victim deposits `amount` A such that `(A * S) / B == 0`.
3. Vault transfers A tokens in, but `shares` remains S and the depositor’s share increment is zero.
4. The depositor’s funds are effectively locked, and `sharePrice = balance/shares` increases for everyone else

### Impact

Victims can lose ≥0.01% of their deposit on each tiny deposit, repeatable indefinitely.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either guard against zero-share mints:

```solidity
uint256 shares = (balance == 0)
    ? amount * SHARE_RESOLUTION
    : (amount * reserve.shares[idx]) / balance;
require(shares > 0, "Deposit too small");

```

or switch to a finer-grained share resolution (e.g. 1e18) so that realistic deposits always convert to ≥1 share.
