# Reentrancy is allowed in 'burn' via malicious EOA/contracts



**Severity: CRITICAL** 
   Likelihood - high
   Impact- high

**Description :**
 Affected LoC : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L395-L402

 A **reentrancy vulnerability** in the `burn` function of `Burve.sol` allows a malicious `token0` or `token1` to re-enter `burn` during `safeTransfer` calls (lines 395-402), enabling an attacker to drain all `token0` and `token1` held by the contract. The vulnerability arises because external calls to `token0.transfer` and `token1.transfer` occur **before** critical state updates (`totalNominalLiq` at line 366, `totalShares` at line 389), violating the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern. The contract assumes `token0` and `token1` are trusted, non-reentrant ERC20 tokens, but this is not enforced, allowing a malicious token to recursively call `burn` and inflate `postBalance0`/`postBalance1`, stealing tokens.

### Root Cause

**Unvalidated assumption:**
 The contract assumes that `token0` and `token1` are standard ERC20 tokens that do not re-enter `Burve.sol` during `safeTransfer`. This is not enforced, as there is no `ReentrancyGuard` or validation of token contracts, allowing malicious tokens to exploit the vulnerability.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The following conditions must be met for the reentrancy attack to succeed:
1. **Caller Holds LP Shares**: The attacker must have `balanceOf(msg.sender) >= shares` to call `burn` (line 390).
2. **Valid Price Limits**: `lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96` and `upperSqrtPriceLimitX96` must pass `withinSqrtPX96Limits` (line 352).
3. **Contract Token Balances**: `Burve.sol` must hold non-zero `token0`/`token1` balances (lines 368-369, 393-394).
4. **Malicious Token**: `token0` or `token1` must be a malicious contract that re-enters `burn` during `safeTransfer` (lines 395-402).
5. **Non-Zero State Variables**: `totalShares` and `totalNominalLiq` must be non-zero to compute `burnLiqNominal` (line 362).
6. **Sufficient Gas**: The transaction must have enough gas for multiple `burn` calls.

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Malicious Token Configured**: `token0` or `token1` must be a malicious ERC20 contract with a `transfer` function that re-enters `burn` (lines 395-402).
2. **Token Returns from Pool/Island**: Uniswap V3 `pool` (lines 438, 443-449) or Kodiak `island` (line 431) must return non-zero `token0`/`token1` when burning liquidity.
3. **Liquidity in External Protocols**: `pool` or `island` must hold sufficient `token0`/`token1` liquidity in active positions managed by `Burve.sol`.


### Attack Path

1. An attacker deploys a malicious `token0` contract with a `transfer` function that re-enters `Burve.sol`’s `burn` function.
2. The attacker acquires or mints LP shares in `Burve.sol` (e.g., via `mint`).
3. The attacker calls `burn(100, 0, type(uint160).max)` to burn 100 shares.
4. During `burn`, `safeTransfer` (line 395) calls `token0.transfer`, triggering the malicious token’s `transfer` function.
5. The malicious `transfer` function calls `burn(100, 0, type(uint160).max)` again, executing `burnIsland` (line 377) or `burnV3` (line 383), which collects additional tokens from `pool.collect` or `island.burn`.
6. This increases `postBalance0`/`postBalance1` (lines 393-394), allowing the attacker to transfer more tokens than their share.
7. The attacker repeats this process, draining all `token0`/`token1` in the contract.

### Impact

**Theft**: An attacker can drain all `token0` and `token1` in the contract, potentially worth millions, depending on the contract’s balance.
**State Corruption**: Repeated burns before state updates desynchronize `totalNominalLiq` and `totalShares`, breaking the invariant “`totalNominalLiq == sum of range liquidity`.”
**Invariant Violated**: “Tokens transferred <= collected from `pool.collect` and `island.burn`” is broken, as attackers transfer more tokens than collected.

**What is expected?**
  - Expected: `burn` transfers `token0`/`token1` proportional to `burnLiqNominal` (calculated from `shares`), burns liquidity via `burnV3` or `burnIsland`, and updates `totalNominalLiq`/`totalShares` atomically.
  - Reality: Reentrancy allows multiple transfers before state updates, inflating payouts.
  
**What is allowed?**
  - Allowed: A malicious `token0` can re-enter `burn` during `safeTransfer`, executing `burn` again to collect extra 
     tokens, inflating `postBalance0`/`postBalance1`.

**What was assumed but never enforced?**
  - Assumed: `token0`/`token1` are non-reentrant and trusted.
  - Reality: No `ReentrancyGuard` or validation enforces this, breaking the invariant “Tokens transferred <= collected.”

### Mitigation

1. **Add ReentrancyGuard**:
   - Use OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard` with a `nonReentrant` modifier on `burn` to prevent recursive calls.
   - Example: `function burn(...) external nonReentrant withinSqrtPX96Limits(...)`.

2. **Follow Checks-Effects-Interactions**:
   - Update `totalNominalLiq` and `totalShares` before external calls (`safeTransfer`, `pool.burn`, `island.burn`).
   - Example:
     "totalNominalLiq -= burnLiqNominal;
     totalShares -= shares;
     _burn(msg.sender, shares);"
