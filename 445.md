# Potential Incorrect Target Value Calculation Due to Stale ftX128 Value

### Summary

In `Value.sol`, within the `t()` function's second iteration loop, there is a potential issue where the `ftX128` value used for comparison could be stale, leading to incorrect validation of the target value calculation. This occurs because `tX128` is modified before the validation check but `ftX128` is not recalculated with the new `tX128` value.

### Root Cause

The issue is located in the second iteration loop of the `t()` function where the code attempts to find a solution with relaxed constraints. The problem arises in the following sequence:

1. `tX128` is modified by `stepT()`
2. The validation check uses the old `ftX128` value that was calculated with the previous `tX128`
3. This can lead to accepting an invalid solution because the comparison is made with a stale `ftX128` value

Relevant code:
```solidity
for (uint8 i = 0; i < searchParams.maxIter; ++i) {
    ftX128 = f(tX128, esX128, xs);
    if (-deMinX128 <= ftX128 && ftX128 <= searchParams.targetSlippageX128) {
        done = true;
        break;
    }
    tX128 = stepT(tX128, esX128, xs, ftX128);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

specific conditions where the `stepT()` calculation significantly changes `tX128`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Initial `tX128 = 1000`
2. `ftX128` is calculated as 50
3. `stepT()` modifies `tX128` to 500
4. The validation check still uses `ftX128 = 50` (stale value)
5. The check might pass even though the actual `ftX128` for the new `tX128` would be outside acceptable bounds


### Impact


1. Accept an invalid solution that doesn't actually meet the target slippage requirements
2. Lead to incorrect token value calculations in the protocol




### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, recalculate `ftX128` after modifying `tX128` and before performing the validation check. Here's the suggested code modification:

```solidity
for (uint8 i = 0; i < searchParams.maxIter; ++i) {
    tX128 = stepT(tX128, esX128, xs, ftX128);
    ftX128 = f(tX128, esX128, xs);  // Recalculate with new tX128
    if (-deMinX128 <= ftX128 && ftX128 <= searchParams.targetSlippageX128) {
        done = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

This ensures that the validation check is always performed with the current `ftX128` value corresponding to the latest `tX128`.
