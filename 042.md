# Incorrect Internal Balance Handling in sendBalance() Enables Exchange Failure and Accounting Inconsistency

### Summary

In the BGTExchanger contract, the administrator can use the sendBalance() function to transfer out any token, including the BGT token. However, when BGT tokens are withdrawn this way, the internal bgtBalance variable is not decremented. This leads to a mismatch between the contract’s internal accounting and actual token holdings, potentially resulting in exchange failures or overestimated liquidity being presented to users.

### Root Cause

```solidity
function sendBalance(address token, address to, uint256 amount) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, to, amount);
}
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L110
```
If token == bgtToken, the actual BGT held by the contract decreases, but bgtBalance remains unchanged. This causes viewExchange() and exchange() to incorrectly report available BGT, leading to potential underflow, revert, or UI inconsistencies.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- bgtBalance > 0
- sendBalance(bgtToken, ...) is called without adjusting bgtBalance

### External Pre-conditions

- A user attempts to exchange() inToken for BGT after a manual withdrawal has occurred
- The frontend or protocol logic relies on bgtBalance to determine availability

### Attack Path

1. bgtBalance = 10,000, real balance = 10,000 BGT
2. Admin calls sendBalance(bgtToken, attacker, 6,000)
3. Real balance becomes 4,000, but bgtBalance still shows 10,000
4. User calls exchange() to receive 5,000 BGT
5. Logic allows it (bgtBalance ≥ 5,000), but transfer fails due to insufficient real balance
6. Revert occurs → user funds locked, protocol service degraded

### Impact

This bug enables a mismatch between internal and actual balances, causing exchange() to either revert or provide misleading results to the user. In worst-case scenarios, it may cause a partial DoS for the exchange function and damage protocol reliability

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify sendBalance() to subtract from bgtBalance when transferring BGT:
```solidity
if (token == bgtToken) {
    require(bgtBalance >= amount, "Insufficient internal balance");
    bgtBalance -= amount;
}
```
