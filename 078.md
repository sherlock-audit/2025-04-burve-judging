# Balance can be manipulated through single token deposits in `Closure.sol`

### Summary

The [addValueSingle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L100-L135) function in `ValueFacet` contract which calls the internal [addValueSingle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L147-L210) in `Closure` contract allows an attacker to manipulate a closure’s balance ratios by depositing large amounts of a single token. This skews swap pricing in `swapInExact` or `swapOutExact`, enabling the attacker to extract valuable tokens at favorable rates, causing financial loss to liquidity providers and disrupting the pool’s economic stability

### Root Cause

The internal `ClosureImpl.addValueSingle` function in `Closure.sol` lacks validation to prevent disproportionate single-token balance increases, and its caller, `VaultFacet.addValueSingle`, does not enforce balance ratio limits or cap the impact of deposits on swap pricing. This allows an attacker to skew the closure’s `balances` array, making one token dominant and affecting swap pricing.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The closure identified by `ClosureId cid` must have multiple tokens (vertices) with non-zero balances to enable swaps and balance manipulation.
- The token used for deposits (mapped to `VertexId vid`) must be part of the closure (`cid.contains(vid)`).
- The closure must not be empty (`Store.closure(cid`) validates `cid`).

### External Pre-conditions

- The attacker must have a large supply of the token to deposit (e.g., token A), sufficient to significantly increase its balance relative to others, up to `HARD_BALANCE_CAP` (`2^96`).
- The closure must contain at least one valuable token (e.g., token B) with a higher market price than the deposited token to make the attack profitable.
- The attacker must be able to pay the tax (`baseFeeX128`, e.g., 0.3%) on each deposit.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls `ValueFacet.addValueSingle(recipient, _closureId, value, bgtValue, token, maxRequired)` with large value for token A, increasing `balances[vid.idx()]` via `ClosureImpl.addValueSingle` until it dominates or hits `HARD_BALANCE_CAP`, paying `baseFeeX128` tax per call.
2. The attacker calls `SwapFacet.swapOutExact(cid, inVid, outVid, outAmount)` to extract token B `(outVid`). Skewed balances reduce the required token A input, making swaps favorable.
3. The attacker repeats deposits and swaps, selling extracted token B (e.g., $1 vs. $0.01 for token A) on an external market for profit


### Impact

**Economic Instability**: Skewed balances disrupt swap pricing, making the closure less attractive for honest swappers and reducing trading activity.
**Asset Drain**: Valuable tokens (e.g., token B) are extracted, reducing the pool’s Total Value Locked (TVL).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check in `ClosureImpl.addValueSingle()` or `ValueFacet.addValueSingle()` to ensure no token’s balance exceeds a percentage (e.g., 50%) of the total value
