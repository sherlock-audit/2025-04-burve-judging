# Unvalidated Closure Creation Can Cause Denial of Service (DoS)

### Summary

Lack of validation during closure creation will cause a Denial of Service for the protocol users as an attacker will submit malformed closures that block correct operations.



### Root Cause

In [Closure.sol:24-42](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L24-L42) the Closure struct is instantiated and loaded without validation checks to ensure the closure graph is fully connected and valid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin (or closure creator) needs to call logic that creates or modifies a Closure.
2. The closure structure must not have a valid "connected" graph.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Admin or user creates a Closure with incomplete data (missing nodes or broken linkages).
2. System attempts to resolve the Closure.
3. Resolution logic fails or gets stuck.
4. Subsequent operations depending on that Closure (e.g., swaps, moves) fail for all users.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of functionality: users cannot execute actions involving the broken Closure.
No funds are stolen, but service outage could occur.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add strict validations during Closure creation:

- Ensure closures are connected.
- Ensure no dangling references.
- Require min nodes/edges conditions.
