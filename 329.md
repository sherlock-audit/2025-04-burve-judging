# `ReserveLib::withdraw()` is mis-named (should be `redeem()`) leading to violates EIP-4626 conventions

### Summary

Using the EIP-4626 name `withdraw()` while the sole argument represents **shares** will cause share/asset unit confusion for future integrators and reviewers.  
This naming mismatch does **not create an immediate exploit**, because `ReserveLib` is an internal library, but it will cause maintenance risk: any new code that assumes the canonical 4626 signature may burn or mint the wrong number of shares, breaking accounting invariants later on.

### Root Cause

[`ReserveLib.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Reserve.sol#L66)  the function is declared as:  

```solidity
/// Withdraw the redemption value of the given shares to this contract from the vault.
/// @dev We round down the redeemed value for safety reasons.
function withdraw(
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 shares                      // <-- actually shares, not assets
) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    ...
    amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
    vProxy.withdraw(RESERVEID, amount); // transfers *amount* assets
    reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;      // burns *shares*
}
```

According to EIP-4626:  
* `withdraw(uint256 assets, address receiver, address owner)` — “assets in, shares out”  
* `redeem(uint256 shares , address receiver, address owner)`  — “shares in, assets out”  

Here the implementation clearly follows **redeem** semantics (shares in, assets out) but is labelled **withdraw**, violating the standard.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A — the function is `internal`; no external actor can currently exploit it.  
The problem is strictly a **developer trap**

### Impact

Potential future integrations or upgrades may mis-handle share/asset match leading to incorrect accounting.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Rename the function to `redeem()`
