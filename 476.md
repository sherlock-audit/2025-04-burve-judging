# Overpayment via Rounding Up in Reserve Withdrawals may Lock Last Withdrawers Funds

### Summary

The reserve system relies on share-based accounting to distribute earnings accumulated via `trimBalance()`. When shares are withdrawn, the proportional asset value is calculated using the vault's balance. However, the call:

```solidity
uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
```

passes `true` for rounding **up**, meaning the `balance()` function may report 1 wei than the vault truly holds. This inflates the `amount` calculated for early withdrawers:

```solidity
amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
```

The vaultâ€™s real balance cannot sustain these rounded-up values across all withdrawals. Eventually, the last withdrawer's call will fail in collectEarnings call

### Root Cause

The vault proxy's `balance()` function is instructed to round up:

```solidity
uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true); // Rounds up
```

This causes:

1. Early `withdraw()` calls to slightly **overestimate** the reserve's asset base.
2. Each withdrawal removes the correct share count, but is paid higher in underlying tokens.
4. The final withdrawer can't withdraw because it will fail in withdraw call

Therefore, the final withdrawer's funds are locked in the contract.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. Total Assets and Shares are not divisible
2. Alice withdraws her earnings and leaved the reserve still not divisible ( pretty high likelihood )
3. Bob tries to withdraw but it's failed because balance is not divisible and it will underflow in share removal

`self.shares[cid] -= sharesToRemove;`

Because RESERVEID doesn't have that share amount right now

### Impact

It will lock the final withdrawers balance in the contract

### Mitigation

Round down instead of round up
