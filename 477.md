# `removeValueSingle` protocol fee bypass allows users to withdraw full amount (no tax deducted)

### Summary

A circular dependency in the fee calculation logic in `ValueFacet.sol` allows users to withdraw their full balance without paying protocol fees. This violates protocol economic invariants and results in loss of fee revenue for the protocol.

### Root Cause

In [ValueFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214-L245), the `removeValueSingle` function calculates `realTax` using `removedBalance` before `removedBalance` is assigned. As a result, `realTax` is always zero and no fee is deducted from user withdrawals.

- `realTax` is calculated using `removedBalance` before it is set, so the protocol fee is always zero.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin sets a nonzero fee for a closure using `setClosureFees`.
2. User deposits value into the closure using `addValueSingle`.


### External Pre-conditions

None required; all actions are internal to the protocol.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits value into a closure with a nonzero fee set.
2. User calls `removeValueSingle` to withdraw their value.
3. Due to the bug, no fee is deducted from the withdrawal and the user receives the full amount.
4. The protocol does not collect any fee revenue from this withdrawal.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of all intended fee revenue for withdrawals using `removeValueSingle`. Users can bypass protocol fees entirely for single-token withdrawals, violating economic invariants and reducing protocol sustainability.

### PoC

```solidity
function testRemoveValueSingle_NoTaxBug() public {
    // Set a fee for the closure
    uint16 closureId = 0x9;
    uint256 oneX128 = 1 << 128;
    vm.prank(owner);
    simplexFacet.setClosureFees(closureId, uint128(oneX128 / 100), 0); // 1% fee

    // Fund and add value as Alice
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    uint128 value = 1e18;
    uint128 bgtValue = 0;
    valueFacet.addValueSingle(alice, closureId, value, bgtValue, tokens[0], 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Check Alice's token balance before remove
    uint256 balBefore = ERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(alice);

    // Remove value using removeValueSingle, expecting a fee to be deducted
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    valueFacet.removeValueSingle(alice, closureId, value, bgtValue, tokens[0], 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Check Alice's token balance after remove
    uint256 balAfter = ERC20(tokens[0]).balanceOf(alice);
    uint256 received = balAfter - balBefore;

    // With a 1% fee, Alice should receive less than the full amount
    // But due to the bug, she receives the full amount (no fee deducted)
    assertEq(received, value, "BUG: No tax deducted! Alice received less than expected.");

    // There should be no earnings for the protocol (fee not collected)
    (, , uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory earnings, ) = valueFacet.queryValue(address(this), closureId);
    assertEq(earnings[0], 0, "BUG: Protocol did not collect fee");
}
```

### Mitigation

Calculate `realTax` using `realRemoved` instead of `removedBalance`, and assign `removedBalance` after the tax is calculated:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;

```
