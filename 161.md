# Potential revert in `viewAccumulatedFees()` due to unhandled undeflows

### Summary
The `viewAccumulatedFees()` function calculates fees owed to a liquidity position by subtracting historical fee growth from current fee growth. However, it performs this subtraction without using an unchecked block in `Solidity ≥0.8.0`, causing the call to revert when the difference underflows (which is an expected and acceptable scenario in Uniswap V3’s design). As a result, fee calculations can fail.


### Root Cause
Uniswap V3’s [logic](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/libraries/Position.sol#L60-L76) expects fee growth values to wrap around uint256 boundaries due to <0.8.x version used.
```solidity
        // calculate accumulated fees
        uint128 tokensOwed0 =
            uint128(
                FullMath.mulDiv(
                    feeGrowthInside0X128 - _self.feeGrowthInside0LastX128,
                    _self.liquidity,
                    FixedPoint128.Q128
                )
            );
        uint128 tokensOwed1 =
            uint128(
                FullMath.mulDiv(
                    feeGrowthInside1X128 - _self.feeGrowthInside1LastX128,
                    _self.liquidity,
                    FixedPoint128.Q128
                )
            );
```
However, although function [`getFeeGrowthInside()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Fees.sol#L106-L132) correctly accounts for Uniswap V3's principled use of `underflow` to
calculate feeGrowthInside[0/1]X128 the [`viewAccumulatedFees()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Fees.sol#L48-L59) function does not use an unchecked block for this.
```solidity
        // @audit-issue No underflow allowed because liquidity is uint128
        tokensOwed0 = uint128(
            X128.mul256(
                liquidity,
                feeGrowthInside0X128 - feeGrowthInside0LastX128
            )
        );
        tokensOwed1 = uint128(
            X128.mul256(
                liquidity,
                feeGrowthInside1X128 - feeGrowthInside1LastX128
            )
        );
```
Note that there is no check that `freeGrowthInside0X128 > feeGrowthInside0LastX128`.

Consider the following scenario:
• A Uniswap position has its `feeGrowthInside0X128` calculated, but an underflow happened during the
calculation. e.g. `feeGrowthInside0X128 == type(uint256).max - 1e18 + 1`.
• An user opens a position and has this value stored in the Info's `feeGrowthInside0LastX128` field.
• During the duration that this position is open, the Uniswap position has its values changed such that a call to
Base- getFeeGrowthInside returns a small positive value. e.g. `feeGrowthInside0X128 == 2e18`.
• User then calls `queryValue()` calling `viewAccumulatedFees()`. However, it is not true that `feeGrowthInside0X128 > feeGrowthInside0LastX128` 


### Internal Pre-conditions
1. `viewAccumulatedFees()` is called with a `feeGrowthInsideLast` value that is larger than the current `feeGrowthInside`.
2. The pool uses Solidity `0.8.0` or above, which enforces overflow/underflow checks.


### External Pre-conditions
1. A liquidity provider attempts to view or collect accumulated fees through a function that uses `viewAccumulatedFees()`.
2. The provider’s last collected state (`feeGrowthInsideLast`) is outdated due to large fee accumulation or tick shifts.


### Attack Path
1. Fee accumulation causes wraparound or lower fee growth values due to tick movement.
2. LP calls `viewAccumulatedFees()`.
3. Subtraction underflows: `feeGrowthInside - feeGrowthInsideLast < 0`.
4. Solidity reverts.

### Impact
Liquidity providers may experience failed transactions when querying position data.


### Mitigation
Modify as follows:
```diff
+   unchecked {
        tokensOwed0 = uint128(
            X128.mul256(
                liquidity,
                feeGrowthInside0X128 - feeGrowthInside0LastX128
            )
        );
        tokensOwed1 = uint128(
            X128.mul256(
                liquidity,
                feeGrowthInside1X128 - feeGrowthInside1LastX128
            )
        );
+   }
```
