# Circular reference in BGTExchanger backup system leads to DOS

### Summary

The lack of circular reference validation in BGTExchanger's backup system will cause denial of service for users as any transaction calling [`getOwed()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L72) will fail with out-of-gas errors when admin accidentally sets a circular backup chain.

### Root Cause

In `BGTExchanger.sol:71-76` the implementation of [`getOwed()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L72) function recursively calls the backup exchanger without any mechanism to detect or prevent circular references in the backup chain.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin accidentally sets up a circular backup chain during a migration/upgrade process:
   - Initially, Admin sets new Exchanger B to use existing Exchanger A as backup (intended behavior)
   - Later, during configuration management or by a different team member, someone sets Exchanger A to use Exchanger B as backup
   - This creates a circular reference: A → B → A
2. Admin needs to call `setBackup()` to create a circular reference chain (Contract A → Contract B → Contract A, or any longer cycle)
3. At least one user needs to have a non-zero owed amount in one of the exchangers

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Admin (intentionally or accidentally) sets up a circular backup chain using the `setBackup()` function**
- Example: Exchanger A points to Exchanger B as backup
- Example: Exchanger B points to Exchanger A as backup
2. **A user calls `getOwed(address)` to check their balance or calls `withdraw()` which internally calls `getOwed()`**
3. **The `getOwed()` function in Exchanger A calls `getOwed()` in Exchanger B**
4. **The `getOwed()` function in Exchanger B recursively calls `getOwed()` in Exchanger A**
5. **This creates an infinite recursion loop**
6. **The transaction reverts due to out-of-gas error, rendering the exchangers unusable**

### Impact

The users of the affected BGTExchangers cannot:
1. Check their owed balances using `getOwed()`
2. Withdraw their owed tokens using `withdraw()` since it internally calls `getOwed()`

### PoC

Add this test in BGTExchanger.t.sol
```solidity
    function testCircularBackupReference() public {
        // Start as owner
        vm.startPrank(owner);

        // Create two BGT exchangers
        BGTExchanger exchangerA = new BGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
        BGTExchanger exchangerB = new BGTExchanger(address(ibgt));

        // Create circular reference: A points to B and B points to A
        exchangerA.setBackup(address(exchangerB));
        exchangerB.setBackup(address(exchangerA));

        // Set up debts with exposed variants (still as owner)
        ExposedBGTExchanger exposedA = new ExposedBGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
        exposedA.setBackup(address(exchangerB));
        exposedA.setOwed(alice, 1 ether);

        ExposedBGTExchanger exposedB = new ExposedBGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
        exposedB.setBackup(address(exposedA));
        exposedB.setOwed(alice, 1 ether);

        vm.stopPrank();

        // This will cause infinite recursion when calling getOwed
        // We'll use vm.expectRevert to handle the call that should fail due to out-of-gas
        vm.expectRevert();
        exposedA.getOwed(alice);
    }
```

### Mitigation

**Add validation when setting a backup**:

```solidity
        function setBackup(address backup) external {
            AdminLib.validateOwner();
            
            // Check for direct circular reference
            require(backup != address(this), "BGTExchanger: Cannot set self as backup");
            
            // Check for indirect circular reference (optional, requires traversal)
            address current = backup;
            for (uint i = 0; i < 10 && current != address(0); i++) {
                IBGTExchanger backupExchanger = IBGTExchanger(current);
                current = address(backupExchanger.backupEx());
                require(current != address(this), "BGTExchanger: Circular reference detected");
            }
            
            backupEx = IBGTExchanger(backup);
        }
        ```
