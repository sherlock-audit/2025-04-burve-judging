# Incomplete slippage protection

### Summary

The Burve contract depends on the current spot price (`sqrtRatioX96`) from Uniswap V3’s `slot0()` for critical arithmetic operations during liquidity minting and share distribution. Since `slot0` reflects the instantaneous pool price, it is prone to rapid fluctuations and manipulation.

### Root Cause

There are several usages of slot0 in [Burve ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L106-L123)contract: `(uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();` Using a raw spot price (slot0) instead of a more stable Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) exposes the contract to price manipulation and front-running risks.

The `withinSqrtPX96Limits` modifier is used to ensure that the current pool price (`sqrtRatioX96`) lies within a user-specified range when minting or burning liquidity:
```solidity
modifier withinSqrtPX96Limits(
    uint160 lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96,
    uint160 upperSqrtPriceLimitX96
) {
    (uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
    if (
        sqrtRatioX96 < lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96 ||
        sqrtRatioX96 > upperSqrtPriceLimitX96
    ) {
        revert SqrtPriceX96OverLimit(
            sqrtRatioX96,
            lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96,
            upperSqrtPriceLimitX96
        );
    }
    _;
}
```
its effectiveness is limited by the fact that `sqrtRatioX96` is derived from `slot0()` — the current pool price, which can be manipulated in the same block via a flashloan or sandwich attack.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract uses the Uniswap V3 pool's current state via slot0() without validating price consistency.

- It does not impose slippage limits or use time-weighted pricing mechanisms.

### External Pre-conditions

- The Uniswap V3 pool must be manipulable—typically during low liquidity periods or when a single actor controls significant liquidity.
- Attackers can momentarily shift the pool price by performing large swaps (e.g., token0 → token1) before calling the mint function.

### Attack Path

Manipulate pool price by swapping assets in the V3 pool to push slot0 up or down

### Impact

Honest users may receive fewer shares than expected.
