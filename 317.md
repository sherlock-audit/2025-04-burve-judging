# M[01]-Blocked Rewards Claim Due to BGT Transfer Restriction

## Summary
The `collectEarnings` function attempts to transfer the `$BGT` reward to users without checking whether transfers are currently permitted. Since `$BGT` is `non-transferable` except under strict `governance whitelist` conditions, this can cause claims to revert entirely, including `non-BGT` rewards. This breaks user access to earned protocol rewards if ever `BGT` whitelist permissions are revoked.

## Vulnerability Details

`$BGT` is `non-transferable` by design unless the caller is an explicitly whitelisted sender. The transfer logic in the $BGT contract enforces this via modifier:

 https://berascan.com/address/0x656b95E550C07a9ffe548bd4085c72418Ceb1dba#code

` onlyApprovedSender(msg.sender)`

although, in the `collectEarnings` function:

```solidity
if (collectedBgt > 0)
    // @audit this will revet if whitelist is removed
    IBGTExchanger(Store.simplex().bgtEx).withdraw(
        recipient,
        collectedBgt
    );
```

This blindly assumes BGT transfers will succeed. However, if the `bgtEx` contract is not `whitelisted` or it has been revoked by the governance, (this can be revoked due to governance proposals) then the above will revert, causing the entire `collectEarnings` call to fail, even if the user is also entitled to claim `non-BGT` rewards (e.g., USDC, USDT).


## Attack Scenario
1. During a governance period where BGT transfers are disabled (e.g., whitelist removed),

2. Attacker Alice uses protocol functionality to mint small BGTValue for Bob (e.g., by interacting on his behalf),

3. Bob attempts to call collectEarnings() to claim his regular share of non-BGT rewards,

4. Since he now has collectedBgt > 0, the function tries to transfer BGT,

5. Transfer fails due to whitelist restriction,

6. Entire call reverts, and Bob is denied access to all of his rewards.



## Impact

All rewards are locked for users with BGT balances during whitelist off-periods.
Griefing vector: Attackers can intentionally mint BGT to victims to trap them in a revert condition.
Governance rigidity: This can either be due Temporary or permanenet revoke of whitelist, BGT transfer restrictions can unintentionally break unrelated reward logic.

## Recommendation 
1. Gracefully handle BGT transfer failures and isolate it from the rest of the reward logic.

Example:

```solidity
try IBGTExchanger(Store.simplex().bgtEx).withdraw(recipient, collectedBgt) {
    // success
} catch {
    // Log the failure but continue with other token transfers
}
```

2. A more robust pattern would defer BGT claiming to a separate call so BGT issues never block standard earnings.
