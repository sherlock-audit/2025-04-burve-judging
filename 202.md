# Incorrect Tax Calculation in removeValueSingle leads to no tax

### Title
Incorrect Tax Calculation in `removeValueSingle` leads to no tax

### Severity
Impact: Medium.
	•	Manager/Protocol fees on one‐sided withdrawals are nearly eliminated, reducing protocol revenue and over‐crediting users.
Likelihood: High.
	•	Every single‐token withdrawal uses this path; any nonzero nominalTax will be ignored.

### Difficulty


### Type


### Target
src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol

## Description
In `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle`, the code computes the real‐world tax `realTax` using `removedBalance` —the post‐tax amount—instead of using the gross withdrawn amount `realRemoved`. At the point of the FullMath.mulDiv call, `removedBalance` is still uninitialized (zero) or carries an old value, causing `realTax` to be drastically understated (often zero), and thus users effectively receive their full withdrawal with no tax.

```solidity
        uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            removedBalance,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );
```

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	User A calls removeValueSingle(…, value, bgtValue, token, minReceive).
	2.	Internally, removedNominal and realRemoved are computed correctly.
	3.	Because removedBalance is still zero,
```solidity
realTax = (0 * nominalTax) / removedNominal = 0;
```
	4.	removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax = realRemoved.
	5.	User A receives 100% of their withdrawal with no tax, even though the protocol expected to collect realRemoved × nominalTax / removedNominal.

## Recommendations
Compute realTax from the gross withdrawal amount:
```solidity
        uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            realRemoved,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );
```
