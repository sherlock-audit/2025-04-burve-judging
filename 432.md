# Users will receive less tokens when using `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle(...)` due to double tax

### Summary

_NB: This issue assumes that issue `removeValueSingle(...) will always produce a zero realTax, leading to issues` has been fixed_

When users want to remove value from a single `vertex` in a `closure` with `removeValueSingle`, the `Burve` protocol charges a tax to prevent users from using add value and remove value as a swapping mechanism. However, the protocol seems to overcharge users on fees when transferring the token amount back to them.

### Root Cause

When the `removedAmount` is calculated in `Closure::removeValueSingle(...)`, it has [the `tax` deducted from it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L288) before being returned. However, in the `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle(...)`, after calculating the `realRemoved` from the `removedAmount`, the tax is [being deducted again](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L241) leading to double tax on what the user should get.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user adds value to a closure with a base fee.
2. The user wants to remove value for a single token

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Users end up receiving fewer tokens than anticipated due to the tax being taken twice.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Do not remove the tax from `removedBalance` in `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle(...)` before transferring the funds to the user.
