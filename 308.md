# Changing E factor directly affect the price of the tokens

### Summary

The protocolâ€™s liquidity accounting relies on a custom value function:

$$
V(x) = (e + 2)t - ((e + 1)^2 * t^2) / (e * t + x)
$$

where `e` is a protocol-controlled constant and `t` is a target amount. This constant is designed to control **liquidity concentration**, but it also directly influences the swap price:

$$
P(x, y) = ((x + e * t)^2) / ((y + e * t)^2)
$$

This function is derived by taking the derivates of value function for both tokens. Therefore, we can say that this is equal to dx/dy

Because `e` modifies both the numerator and denominator symmetrically, small changes to `e` result in significant shifts in price.

### Root Cause

The core of the issue lies in the dual role of `e`:

* **In Value Function `V(x)`**: Affects the slope and shape of the liquidity curve, enabling deeper or shallower concentration around a target.
* **In Price Function `P(x, y)`**: Alters the effective price output, because both input and output sides of the trade are functions of `e`.

This `e` constant can be changed in [simplex](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Simplex.sol#L110)

Since:

$$
P(x, y) = ((x + e * t)^2) / ((y + e * t)^2)
$$

a marginal increase in `e` increases the numerator and denominator asymmetrically, depending on token balances `x` and `y`. This creates an on-chain arbitrage vector.

In following Desmos link, it can be tested:

a,b are balances in here, c is e constant and t is target

For example, consider:

* Low `e`: Swap prices become more sensitive to token imbalance (steeper curve).
* High `e`: Prices flatten out (more stable), but shift baseline value.

This is a systemic design-level risk and not an implementation bug. It requires either parameter access control or a redesign of how `e` influences pricing.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin changes the "e" constant

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. Admin send a transaction to change "e" constant in the simplex
2. Attacker saw this transaction and he frontruns with swap
3. After executions of both transactions, attacker swap again the token with higher price

### Impact

It creates arbitrage opportunity for attackers and it directly affects the price stability of closure. It creates unfair situation for the users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix is not trivial
