# Withdrawal Bypass in Vertex Lock Mechanism Undermines Protocol Security

## Summary
The `withdraw` function in the Vertex contract contains a critical vulnerability that allows users to bypass the locking mechanism by setting the `checkLock` parameter to `false`. This deterministic bug can lead to unauthorized withdrawals from locked vertices, potentially causing loss of funds and undermining the protocol's security model.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `withdraw` function of the VertexImpl library, there is a parameter `checkLock` that determines whether the function should check if the vertex is locked before allowing a withdrawal. If this parameter is set to `false`, the function will allow withdrawals even if the vertex is locked.

From `src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L121-L131:

```solidity
/// Withdraw a specified amount from the holdings of a given closure.
function withdraw(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount,
    bool checkLock
) internal {
    require(!(checkLock && self._isLocked), VertexLocked(self.vid));
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```

The issue is that the `checkLock` parameter is controlled by the caller, and there are instances in the codebase where this parameter is set to `false`, allowing withdrawals from locked vertices.

For example, in the `ValueFacet.removeValue` function, the `withdraw` function is called with `checkLock` set to `false`:

```solidity
function removeValue(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory balancesRemoved) {
    // ... [code omitted for brevity]
    
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
        if (!cid.contains(i)) continue; // Irrelevant token.
        address token = tokenReg.tokens[i];
        uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(
            token,
            balancesRemoved[i],
            false
        );
        Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, realRemoved);
    }
    
    // ... [code omitted for brevity]
}
```

This means that even if a vertex is locked, users can still withdraw funds from it by calling the `removeValue` function, which bypasses the lock check.

The locking mechanism is intended to be a critical security feature of the protocol, as evidenced by the comment in the `VaultFacet.sol` file:

```solidity
/// We add a delay from when a new vault is added so users can withdraw positions if they dislike the vault.
/// This acts as a safeguard against potentially malicious vaults. With locking, this keeps Burve safe from rugs.
/// 5 days was chosen as a reasonable time to broadcast to all our users and give them sufficient time to decide.
uint32 public constant ADD_DELAY = 5 days;
```

By allowing withdrawals from locked vertices, this security feature is effectively bypassed, potentially leading to loss of funds and undermining the protocol's security model.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Bypass of Security Controls**: The locking mechanism is intended to prevent withdrawals from vertices in certain situations (e.g., during migrations or when a token is compromised). By allowing withdrawals from locked vertices, this security control is bypassed.

2. **Potential Loss of Funds**: If a vertex is locked due to a security concern (e.g., a token is compromised), allowing withdrawals could lead to loss of funds.

3. **Inconsistent Protocol State**: The protocol may enter an inconsistent state if withdrawals are allowed from locked vertices, potentially affecting other operations.

4. **Undermining of Protocol's Security Model**: The protocol's security model relies on the ability to lock vertices in certain situations. By allowing withdrawals from locked vertices, this security model is undermined.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur when the `withdraw` function is called with `checkLock` set to `false`
- It directly affects core protocol functionality (the locking mechanism)
- It can lead to loss of funds and undermining of the protocol's security model
- It has no workaround once a vertex is locked

## Proof of Concept
Consider the following scenario:

1. A vertex is locked due to a security concern (e.g., a token is compromised).
2. A user calls the `ValueFacet.removeValue` function to withdraw funds from the locked vertex.
3. The `withdraw` function is called with `checkLock` set to `false`, allowing the withdrawal to proceed even though the vertex is locked.
4. The user successfully withdraws funds from the locked vertex, potentially leading to loss of funds.

This scenario can be demonstrated with the following test:

```solidity
function testWithdrawFromLockedVertex() public {
    // Set up a vertex with some funds
    VertexId vid = VertexLib.newId(0);
    Vertex storage v = Store.load().vertices[vid];
    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(0x1);
    v.init(vid, address(token), address(vault), VaultType.E4626);
    
    // Deposit some funds
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
    vProxy.deposit(cid, 1e6);
    vProxy.commit();
    
    // Lock the vertex
    v.lock();
    
    // Attempt to withdraw with checkLock = true (should fail)
    vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(VertexImpl.VertexLocked.selector, vid));
    v.withdraw(cid, 1e6, true);
    
    // Withdraw with checkLock = false (should succeed)
    v.withdraw(cid, 1e6, false);
    
    // Verify that the withdrawal succeeded
    assertEq(vProxy.balance(cid, false), 0);
}
```

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the design of the `withdraw` function, which allows the caller to bypass the locking mechanism by setting the `checkLock` parameter to `false`. This parameter is intended to be used in specific situations (e.g., during the `trimBalance` function), but it is also used in other functions like `removeValue`, allowing users to bypass the locking mechanism.

## Code Snippet
From `src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L121-L131:

```solidity
/// Withdraw a specified amount from the holdings of a given closure.
function withdraw(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount,
    bool checkLock
) internal {
    require(!(checkLock && self._isLocked), VertexLocked(self.vid));
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several approaches to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Remove the `checkLock` Parameter**: Modify the `withdraw` function to always check if the vertex is locked:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    require(!self._isLocked, VertexLocked(self.vid));
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```

2. **Add a Separate Function for Trusted Withdrawals**: If there are legitimate cases where withdrawals should be allowed from locked vertices, add a separate function that is only callable by trusted entities:

```solidity
function trustedWithdraw(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // No lock check
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```

3. **Add Access Control to the `withdraw` Function**: Modify the `withdraw` function to only allow bypassing the lock check if the caller is a trusted entity:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount,
    bool checkLock
) internal {
    if (checkLock) {
        require(!self._isLocked, VertexLocked(self.vid));
    } else {
        // Only allow trusted entities to bypass the lock check
        require(msg.sender == trustedEntity, "Unauthorized");
    }
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```

Option 1 is the simplest and most direct fix, as it ensures that the locking mechanism is always enforced. However, if there are legitimate cases where withdrawals should be allowed from locked vertices, options 2 or 3 may be more appropriate.
