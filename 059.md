# Loss of Funds Sent Directly to Facet Implementation Addresses

### Summary

The protocol utilizes a diamond proxy pattern where user interactions should occur with the main proxy contract address. The proxy uses `delegatecall` to execute logic defined in separate facet implementation contracts (e.g., `SimplexFacet`). If users, guided by incorrect interfaces, documentation, or third-party tools, transfer ERC20 tokens directly to the address of a facet implementation contract (e.g., the `SimplexFacet.sol` deployment address) instead of the main proxy address, those tokens become permanently locked within the implementation contract.

### Root Cause

Functions executed via `delegatecall` (like `SimplexFacet.withdraw`) operate within the storage context of the calling contract (the proxy). Consequently, `address(this)` [within the function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol#L248) resolves to the proxy address, and token balance checks (`IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this))`) reference the proxy's holdings. Tokens held directly by the implementation contract address are outside the proxy's storage context. The standard diamond pattern and the provided facet implementations lack a mechanism for the proxy or its owner to access or withdraw tokens erroneously sent to the implementation addresses.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  The protocol employs a diamond proxy architecture.
2.  Facet implementation contracts (e.g., `SimplexFacet`) do not contain specific rescue functions to withdraw arbitrary tokens sent directly to their own addresses.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  **Interface Errors:** The official frontend or third-party dapps interacting with the protocol might contain bugs that display or use a facet implementation address instead of the proxy address for certain deposit or transfer actions.
2.  **Incorrect Information:** Users might encounter incorrect addresses in documentation, tutorials, forum posts, or from integrations (e.g., wallet software, portfolio trackers) that mistakenly list a facet implementation address.
3.  **Tooling Issues:** Users employing block explorers or transaction builders might inadvertently copy or use an implementation address, believing it to be the correct interaction point.

### Attack Path

1.  **Information Source:** A user interacts with a frontend application, reads documentation, uses a third-party tool, or consults a block explorer to find the address for interacting with the protocol (e.g., for depositing tokens).
2.  **Incorrect Address Provided:** Due to a bug or error in the information source (as per External Preconditions), the user is presented with or copies the address of a facet implementation contract (e.g., `SimplexFacet`'s deployed address) instead of the main proxy address.
3.  **Mistaken Transfer:** Believing they are interacting correctly with the protocol, the user executes an ERC20 `transfer` targeting the provided implementation contract address.
4.  **Transfer Execution:** The ERC20 token contract successfully transfers the tokens to the implementation contract address.
5.  **Funds Locked:** The tokens now reside at the implementation address. Standard protocol functions (like `SimplexFacet.withdraw`), when called on the proxy, operate on the proxy's balance and cannot access the tokens held by the implementation contract. There is no standard mechanism within the protocol's design to recover these funds.


### Impact

Permanent loss of any ERC20 tokens incorrectly transferred directly to the address of a facet implementation contract. This represents a significant usability risk and potential financial loss for users who encounter incorrect address information or interface errors.
