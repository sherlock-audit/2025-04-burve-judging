# Owner will lock user funds by migrating to an incompatible StationProxy

### Summary

Lack of validation in the StationProxy migration function will cause loss of liquidity access for users as a malicious or careless owner can set an incompatible or malicious proxy address

### Root Cause

in [Burve.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L208-L219) the migrateStationProxy function only checks if the new address is different from the current one without validating the implementation

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Protocol owner needs to call migrateStationProxy() with an address that doesn't implement the correct interface
- Users need to have funds deposited through the StationProxy

### External Pre-conditions

- A malicious or incompatible contract needs to exist at the provided address


### Attack Path

- Owner calls migrateStationProxy() with an incompatible or malicious contract address
- The proxy is updated without validating its implementation
- When users attempt to withdraw their funds via withdrawLP(), the call fails or behaves unexpectedly
- Users are unable to access their funds or lose them entirely

### Impact

Users cannot withdraw their liquidity positions and earn rewards, leading to temporary or permanent loss of funds depending on whether a recovery mechanism exists.

### PoC

```solidity
// Deploy a contract that doesn't implement IStationProxy correctly
contract BrokenProxy {
    // Missing functions or incorrect implementations
    // No withdrawLP function
}

// Owner migrates to the broken proxy
burve.migrateStationProxy(address(new BrokenProxy()));

// User attempts to burn LP tokens
// This will fail as the StationProxy cannot handle island shares properly
```

### Mitigation

Implement proper validation for the new StationProxy, such as calling test functions to ensure the interface is correctly implemented. Consider a timelock mechanism where users have time to exit the protocol if they disagree with the migration.
