# Cannot Transfer BGT, fund() and withdraw() always revert

### Summary

BGTExchanger.fund() and withdraw() calls TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom() and TransferHelper.safeTransfer() against the BGT token, which on Berachain is a soulbound, permissioned ERC‑20. By default, only whitelisted senders may move BGT via transferFrom. Since the exchanger contract was never added to BGT’s whitelist, every call to fund hits the token’s NotApprovedSender() check and reverts.

### Root Cause

This is a conceptual mistake as the BGT.sol contract only allows whitelisted address to transfer BGT. A user's attempt to use the fund() in BGTExchanger.sol will always fail and revert.

[The root cause 1 :](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L116C5-L124C6)

```solidity
function fund(uint256 amount) external {
        bgtBalance += amount;
>>       TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom( //@audit cannot transfer BGT
            bgtToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
    }
```

[The root cause 2 :](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L81C5-L87C6)

```solidity
 function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 bgtAmount) external {
        uint256 _owed = getOwed(msg.sender);
        if (bgtAmount == 0) return;
        if (_owed < bgtAmount) revert InsufficientOwed();
        withdrawn[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
>>   TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, recipient, bgtAmount);//@audit will not work. cannot transfer BGT.
    }
```

[Note the transfer function in BGT.sol is overridden and protected by onlyApprovedSender modifier](https://vscode.blockscan.com/80094/0x656b95E550C07a9ffe548bd4085c72418Ceb1dba):
```solidity
 /// @dev Only allows transfer if the caller is an approved sender and has enough unboosted balance.
    function transfer(
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    )
        public
        override(IERC20, ERC20Upgradeable)
        onlyApprovedSender(msg.sender)
        checkUnboostedBalance(msg.sender, amount)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return super.transfer(to, amount);
    }
```

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. User with BGT interacts with a deployed BGTExchanger contract
2. BGT Admin/Governance has not whitelist BGTExchanger.sol

### External Pre-conditions

1. BGT Governance leaves the Exchanger unapproved
2. BGT token contract enforces whitelist on transfers

### Attack Path

1. Governance deploys the BGT token
2. Exchanger is deployed but not whitelisted
3. User approves the Exchanger (optional)
4. User invokes fund()
5. Exchanger attempts the transfer
6. Helper forwards to BGT contract
7. Helper surfaces a generic revert

Result: The user’s call to fund() sees the revert as expected, and no BGT is ever deposited.


### Impact

1. Complete Denial‑of‑Service for BGT Funding

No user can ever successfully call fund() or withdraw() to deposit or withdraw BGT into/from the exchanger, because every safeTransferFrom and safeTransfer is blocked by the whitelist check in BGT.sol. This means that any downstream feature that depends on users’ BGT balances inside the exchanger—rewards distribution, voting power boosts, swaps, or liquidity provisioning—will be non‑functional too.

2. All Pools with start with a 0 BGT balance which can never change.

### PoC

1. Create a FundBug.t.sol in the test directory and paste the PoC below.
2. Run with forge test --match-contract FundBug -vvvvv

        eth = new MockERC20("eth", "eth", 18);

        vm.startPrank(owner);
        bgtExchanger = new BGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function test_FundReverts() public {
        vm.prank(alice);
        // safeTransferFrom will revert inside fund()
        vm.expectRevert();  
        bgtExchanger.fund(1e18);
    }
}
```

Note: The custom error thrown in the PoC (0xf2d81d95) matches exactly the NotApprovedSender() error in the [BGT.sol ABI](https://github.com/berachain/doc-abis/blob/main/core/BGT.json)



### Mitigation

1. Ensure the exchanger is whitelisted before any calls to fund() and withdraw()
