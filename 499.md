# `MIN_DEAD_SHARES` Set Too Low, Enabling Residual Share Price Manipulation

### Summary

The `MIN_DEAD_SHARES` constant is set to `100`, representing the number of "dead" shares minted during the initial liquidity provision. These shares are meant to anchor the price per share at a neutral baseline and prevent manipulation. However, the value is too small relative to plausible pool sizes and asset precision, making it insufficient as a deterrent against early-stage share price manipulationâ€”even if the initial share recipient is now correctly handled (e.g., burned).


### Root Cause

```solidity
uint256 private constant MIN_DEAD_SHARES = 100;
```

[Code Block](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L26)

Even after fixing the initial bug (i.e., minting to a burn address), this value remains vulnerable due to:

* Low resolution: 100 shares can represent **tiny amounts of liquidity** in real-world deployments.
* Manipulability: If donations or compounding mechanics increase vault balance by only a few tokens, the price per share of the 100 dead shares can increase **orders of magnitude** due to share scarcity.
* Insufficient dampening: These shares do not meaningfully anchor pricing if deposits are small or if the vault receives donations early on.

In effect, even correctly burned dead shares can manipulate downstream price calculations, especially if composability is involved 

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

Attack path is same as inflation attack vector. Nothing is changed. Let say mishandled dead shares problem solved by burning it but this issue is still exist due to low hard coded dead shares variable. 

Attacker can deposit 1000 wei tokens and then donate 10,000e18 DAI ( token is just example ) in order to inflate the share price. 1 wei share price will be inflated 99,900,099,900,099,900 wei token. 

Byfrontrunning the legit users deposit action, his/her tokens will be lost.

### Impact

* Share price remains inflatable during bootstrapping

It's may cause loss of funds for the first depositor because this constant is too low to be secure against inflation attack vector.

### Mitigation

Use bigger dead shares amount like 1e12 ( It depends )
