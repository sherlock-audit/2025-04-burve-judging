# Single Pair LP Token is Not a Fungible LP Token


### Summary
In the currently implemented protocol, the `islandSharesPerOwner` parameter is used during minting, burning, and transferring LP tokens. However, the ratio of `islandSharesPerOwner` to the `LP token` for each user may differ, leading to unfairness during transfers.

### Root Cause
https://docs.burve.fi/use-cases/markdown#stable-pool
> Users simply receive a fungible LP token for depositing.

However, in the code, the `_update` function modifies `islandSharesPerOwner`, which is then utilized during the burn process. This inconsistency creates issues with fungibility.

### PoC
Consider the following scenario:
token0 = USDC, token1 = USDT.
There is `island` and one position in Uniswap V3 Pool. The weight is 0.8 and 0.2.
For simplicity, let's skip the scale and the MIN_DEAD_SHARES.
Alice deposits 1000 USDC and 1000 USDT for 1000 shares.
800 USDC and 800 USDT are deposited to the `island`, while 200 USDC and 200 USDT go to the Uniswap V3 Pool.
At this point: totalShares = 1000, totalNominalLiq = 1000, totalIslandShares = islandSharesPerOwner[Alice] = 800
After some time, 20 USDC and 20 USDT are generated as fees in the Uniswap V3 Pool, increasing totalNominalLiq to 1100.
If Bob mints 1100 nominal liquidity for 1000 shares, he should deposit (1100 * 0.8 + 220 = 1100) USDC and 1100 USDT.
220 USDC and 220 USDT deposited to the Uniswap V3 Pool, 880 USDC and 880 USDT deposited to the island for 880 island shares.
Now: totalShares = 2000, totalNominalLiq = 2200, totalIslandShares = 1680, islandSharesPerOwner[Bob] = 880

If Alice and Bob burn their shares, Alice will receive 1020 USDC and 1020 USDT, while Bob will receive 1100 USDC and 1100 USDT. This is correct based on their contributions.

If both Alice and Bob deposit their shares into a staking pool, later withdrawing results in `islandSharesPerOwner[Alice]` and `islandSharesPerOwner[Bob]` both becoming 840.
Upon burning their shares, both would receive 1060 USDC and 1060 USDT, which is incorrect.

Alice gains 40 USD while Bob loses 40 USD.

### Impact
The core contract functionality is compromised

### Mitigation
Consider the following actions:

1. Remove the islandSharesPerOwner parameter.
2. During the minting process, accurately calculate the amounts of assets required for minting shares based on the total assets (including the island and idle balances) and deposit these assets. Any remaining deposits should be sent to the protocol as rewards.
3. When burning shares, calculate the amounts of assets for burning across all positions (including the island and idle), then send these amounts to users.
4. After this conisder the weights.
