# Double taxation in removeValueSingle due to incorrect tax application sequence

## Summary
The removeValueSingle function in ValueFacet.sol incorrectly charges tax twice by applying it after withdrawal when tax was already deducted from the nominal amount, resulting in users paying double fees on withdrawals.

Root Cause
In ValueFacet.sol:228-242, tax is applied twice:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L228C1-L242C1

```solidity
// First tax application (in removeValueSingle internal call)
(uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(value, bgtValue, vid);
uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
// removedNominal is already tax-adjusted

// Second tax application
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax; // Incorrectly applies tax again
```

## Pre-conditions
Internal Pre-conditions:
1. User must have value in closure
2. Function called with non-zero value
3. Tax rate must be non-zero


## Attack Path
1. User calls removeValueSingle with value = 1000
2. First tax application in removeValueSingle: (simplified)
  - nominalTax = 100 (10% fee)
  - removedNominal = 900 (after tax)
  - realRemoved = 900 (converted to real value)
3. Second tax application:
  - realTax = 90 (10% of 900)
  - removedBalance = 900 - 90 = 810
4. User receives 810 instead of expected 900
   

## Impact
Users lose additional value through double taxation:

1. For 10% fee:
  - Expected: 10% fee on withdrawal
  - Actual: ~19% effective fee rate
2. Significant value loss for users
3. Protocol accumulates excess fees incorrectly


## Mitigation
Remove second tax application:

```diff
function removeValueSingle(
    // ...existing code...
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 removedBalance) {
    // ...existing code...
    
-   Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
    uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            removedBalance,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );
+   Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved + realTax, false);
    c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
-   removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax; // How much the user actually gets.
+   removedBalance = realRemoved;
    require(removedBalance >= minReceive, PastSlippageBounds());
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, removedBalance);
}
```
