# Incorrect Netting in `E4626::commit`

### Summary

In the `VaultE4626Impl` library, the `commit` function attempts to net simultaneous deposit and withdrawal operations to save on gas and avoid redundant interactions. However, in the branch where `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`, the code zeroes out `assetsToDeposit` **before** subtracting it from `assetsToWithdraw`. As a result, the netting logic is broken: instead of withdrawing the correct *difference* between withdrawals and deposits, the contract withdraws the **entire** requested amount. This can be weaponized to extract more assets than entitled, leading to vault depletion and loss of user funds.


### Root Cause


In the `withdraw > deposit` branch, the code sets `assetsToDeposit = 0` **before** computing `assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit`. Since `assetsToDeposit` has just been zeroed, the subtraction is a no-op, So `assetsToWithdraw` remains equal to its original value instead of `assetsToWithdraw - assetsToDeposit`.

```solidity
function commit(VaultE4626 storage self, VaultTemp memory temp) internal {
    uint256 assetsToDeposit = temp.vars[1];
    uint256 assetsToWithdraw = temp.vars[2];

    if (assetsToDeposit > 0 && assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
        // Intended: net out deposits vs. withdrawals
        if (assetsToDeposit > assetsToWithdraw) {
            assetsToDeposit -= assetsToWithdraw;
            assetsToWithdraw = 0;
        } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
            // @audit zeroing deposit BEFORE subtracting
            assetsToDeposit = 0;
            assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;  // assetsToDeposit is now 0!
        } else {
            // exact net, nothing to do
            return;
        }
    }

    if (assetsToDeposit > 0) {
        // deposit logic...
    } else if (assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
        // withdraw logic...
    }
}
```

### Impact


The incorrect netting logic allows to withdraw the full `assetsToWithdraw` amount without deducting the `assetsToDeposit`, leading to vault depletion.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Adjust the netting logic so that in the `withdraw > deposit` branch, the subtraction uses the *original* deposit amount, not the zeroed value:

```diff
    } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
-       assetsToDeposit = 0;
-       assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;  // INCORRECT: assetsToDeposit is now 0
+       uint256 originalDeposit = assetsToDeposit;
+       assetsToDeposit = 0;
+       assetsToWithdraw = assetsToWithdraw - originalDeposit;
```
