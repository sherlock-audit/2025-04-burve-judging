# Stake Removal Does Not Unlock Underlying Vault Balances

### Summary



In the `mint()` function of `ValueTokenFacet`, when a user mints value tokens, their stake is removed using `unstakeValue()`, and asset tracking is cleared via `Store.assets().remove(...)`. However, the actual token balances in the underlying ERC-4626 vaults **remain untouched**, meaning the user’s capital is still exposed to vault-level risk despite having withdrawn their stake.

This disconnect between **logical unstaking and physical vault state** can lead to users incurring yield dilution or losses due to future vault activity, even though their stake has been cleared and they hold no further protocol exposure.

### Root Cause

```solidity
c.unstakeValue(value, bgtValue);
Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
_mint(msg.sender, value);
```

* `unstakeValue(...)` adjusts the accounting in the closure.
* `Store.assets().remove(...)` adjusts internal mappings.
* **But no withdrawal from the vaults is performed**, so the assets remain deposited in the corresponding ERC-4626 strategies or yield sources.

As a result, these lingering balances continue to participate in vault-level accounting or yield-sharing, exposing the user’s capital to risk or dilution **without any active stake** in the system.

In addition, user's potential income will be lost to other users because his stakings are removed

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

No need

### Impact

* **Users may face untracked losses** after "unstaking" due to yield fluctuation, asset volatility, or misallocation..

This issue violates the expectation that minting value tokens (i.e., exiting a stake) results in full release of underlying risk.


### Mitigation

Handle user tokens separately for users who use ValueTokenFacet
