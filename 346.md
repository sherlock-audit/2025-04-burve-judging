# Burve.sol Mint and Burn Fail Due to Missing KodiakIsland Pause Handling

## Summary
In `Burve.sol`, the `mint` and `burn` functions fail entirely when the `KodiakIsland` contract is `paused`, even for operations not tied to it **(e.g., Uniswap V3 pool mints/burns)**. 
This happens because a `revert` in mintIsland or burnIsland (triggered by KodiakIsland’s whenNotPaused modifier) halts the entire transaction, blocking unrelated liquidity operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226

`KodiakIsland.sol` has `mint` and `burn` functions guarded by a `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing it to be `paused`. 
`Burve.sol`, however, lacks **any pause mechanism or handling for this state**. 
In Burve.sol’s mint and burn functions, it loops through all ranges:
    **Island ranges**: Call mintIsland or burnIsland, which invoke KodiakIsland’s mint or burn.
    **Non-island ranges**: Call Uniswap V3 pool’s mint or burn directly.

If KodiakIsland is **paused**, the mintIsland or **burnIsland call reverts**, causing the whole transaction to fail. 
**This stops even the non-island range operations, which should succeed independently.**

## POC
**Setup:** `Burve.sol` has two ranges:
    **Range 1:** Island range.
    **Range 2:** Non-island range.

**State:** KodiakIsland is paused (e.g., due to an emergency).

**Action:** User calls mint in `Burve.sol` to add liquidity only to non-island Range.

**Result:**
Loop hits Range 1, mintIsland calls KodiakIsland.mint, which **reverts** due to **whenNotPaused**.

**Entire mint transaction fails, blocking Range 2’s Uniswap V3 mint.**

Same issue occurs in burn: a paused KodiakIsland stops all burns, even for non-island ranges.

## Impact
This bug locks users out of core functionality with severe consequences:
    **User Scenario 1:** A trader wants to `mint 10 ETH` of liquidity in a `non-island range` during a market dip. 
    `KodiakIsland` is paused due to a bug fix. The mint fails, and they **miss a 20% price rebound, losing $2,000 in potential profit**.
    **User Scenario 2:** During a crash, a user tries to `burn 5 ETH` of liquidity from a non-island range to exit their position. 
    KodiakIsland is paused, burn reverts, and **they’re stuck as prices drop 30%, costing $1,500**.

**Protocol Risk: If KodiakIsland pauses for days (e.g., after an exploit), Burve.sol becomes unusable, freezing all user funds in non-island ranges. 
This could tank trust, trigger mass withdrawals post-unpause, and crash the protocol’s TVL.**

Due to this it should be marked as `MEDIUM`

## Code Snippet
If mintIsland reverts, the loop stops, and non-island pool.mint calls never execute in Burve::mint :
```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
    uint128 liqInRange = uint128(shift96(uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true));
    if (liqInRange == 0) continue;
    TickRange memory range = ranges[i];
    if (range.isIsland()) {
        islandShares = mintIsland(recipient, liqInRange); // Reverts if KodiakIsland paused
    } else {
        pool.mint(address(this), range.lower, range.upper, liqInRange, abi.encode(msg.sender));
    }
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify Burve.sol’s mint and burn to skip island ranges when KodiakIsland is paused:
```diff
if (range.isIsland()) {
+    if (!island.paused()) { // Check pause state (assumes paused() exists)
        islandShares = mintIsland(recipient, liqInRange);
     }
} else {
    pool.mint(address(this), range.lower, range.upper, liqInRange, abi.encode(msg.sender));
}
```
