# When withdrawing BGT balanceof caller is not updated

## Summary
When of swapping of tokens for BGT the user `owed` amount is increased but when withdrawing it fails to update the amount.

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
    function exchange(
        address inToken,
        uint128 amount
    ) external returns (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) {
        if (!isExchanger[msg.sender]) revert NoExchangePermissions();

        (bgtAmount, spendAmount) = viewExchange(inToken, amount);
        if (bgtAmount > 0) {
            bgtBalance -= bgtAmount;
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom( // We take what we need.
                    inToken,
                    msg.sender,
                    address(this),
                    spendAmount
                );
    @>        owed[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
        }
    }
```
As we can see in the pointer after exchanging of tokens the amount of BGT is updated for the caller However, when withdrawing it fails to update the `owed amount of the caller`.
```solidity
    function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 bgtAmount) external {
        uint256 _owed = getOwed(msg.sender);
        if (bgtAmount == 0) return;
        if (_owed < bgtAmount) revert InsufficientOwed();
        withdrawn[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, recipient, bgtAmount);
    }
```
As we can it only updated the amount withdrawn but fails to uppdate the BGT amount transfered

## Impact 
User still retains bgtAmount after withdrawal
## Recommended MIitigation
Update the owed amount to subtract from msg.snder
```solidity
owed[msg.sender] -= bgtAmount;
```
