# Vault deposit will revert and lock user funds

### Summary

A precision-sensitive overflow in `FullMath.mulDiv()` will cause a permanent revert for vault depositors as a user interacting with `VaultE4626.deposit()` will trigger a multiplication overflow due to the use of Solidity 0.8+ without `unchecked` arithmetic.


### Root Cause

The `VaultE4626.deposit()` function uses the `FullMath.mulDiv` helper to calculate the correct amount of shares to mint relative to the vault's total assets:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L146-L150
```solidity
uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
    ? discountedAmount
    : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
```
The `FullMath` library in use is adapted for Solidity `>=0.4.0`, but designed originally for Solidity `0.7.x`, which did not have automatic overflow/underflow checks.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L2
In Solidity `0.8.x` and later, overflow or underflow will revert automatically unless guarded by `unchecked {}` blocks, making `mulDiv` potentially unsafe in certain vault states.

When `self.totalShares * discountedAmount` produces an intermediate value exceeding `2^256-1`, the multiplication overflows before division occurs, causing the transaction to revert permanently, freezing deposits.

Since real-world vaults can accumulate very large `totalShares` values, and `discountedAmount` could be large during a whale deposit, this risk is not just theoretical.

Moreover, `FullMath.mulDiv` is used in many functions of the project.

The same issues with the library can be found here:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. [Depositor needs to call] `deposit()` with `discountedAmount` of approximately `1e24` (1M USDC with 18 decimals)
2. [Vault state needs to be such that] `totalAssets` is very small (e.g., `1e6`) while `totalShares` is large (e.g., `1e18`)


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls `VaultE4626.deposit()` with a high deposit amount (e.g., 1M USDC)
2. Inside `deposit()`, the contract computes `shares = mulDiv(totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets)`
3. The intermediate product `totalShares * discountedAmount` exceeds `2^256 - 1`
4. Solidity 0.8+ overflow check reverts the transaction
5. User cannot proceed with deposit; vault becomes functionally frozen for large deposits

Also, there can be different scenarios where:
Vaults managing huge TVL (>10^25 wei).
Whale deposits (very large single depositors).
Long-lived vaults where `totalShares` have inflated over time.
Price oracle returns `temp.vars[3]` near `1e18`, causing no scaling down of amounts.
So, overflow on `totalShares * discountedAmount` becomes likely.

### Impact

The user cannot deposit tokens. Under certain conditions (low vault liquidity or skewed shares/assets ratio), any large deposit will revert permanently, causing a complete denial-of-service for future deposits and effectively freezing the vault.


### PoC

```solidity
function testDepositRevertOverflow() public {
    // Simulate vault with low liquidity
    uint256 totalAssets = 1e6; // 1 USDC
    uint256 totalShares = 1e18; // 1e18 shares

    // Simulate large user deposit
    uint256 depositAmount = 1e24; // 1M USDC (with 18 decimals)

    // Expect this to revert due to FullMath.mulDiv overflow
    vm.expectRevert();
    vault.deposit(depositAmount, user);
}
```
Also, 
```solidity
function testDepositOverflow() public {
    VaultE4626 storage vault;

    vault.totalShares = 2**200;  // Already very large total shares
    uint256 amount = 2**60;       // Big whale deposit
    VaultTemp memory temp;
    temp.vars[0] = 2**200;         // totalAssets (huge vault)
    temp.vars[1] = 0;              // no pending inflow
    temp.vars[2] = 0;              // no pending redemption
    temp.vars[3] = 1 << 128;       // No discount applied (identity multiplier)

    vm.expectRevert();  // Expecting overflow revert
    vault.deposit(temp, ClosureId.wrap(1), amount);
}
```
Here:
`self.totalShares * discountedAmount` during `mulDiv` calculation would overflow `uint256`.
`FullMath` tries to handle it by splitting into 512-bit parts using assembly, but here logic isn't fully unchecked, Solidity 0.8+ checks trigger a revert.
Therefore, `deposit` permanently fails.

### Mitigation

Use the Uniswap V3 version of FullMath.sol compiled with Solidity <0.8.0, which handles intermediate overflows internally without reverting.
```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.8.0;
```
Or explicitly wrap the `mulDiv()` usage in an `unchecked` block and ensure inputs are sanitized to prevent unsafe overflows.
