# Withdrawal limit bypassed via backup vault

### Summary

The `withdraw()` function https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L186-203 enforces a `maxWithdrawable` limit on the active vault but fails to apply such limit to withdrawals from the backup vault. This allows users to potentially withdraw amounts exceeding the intended system-wide withdrawal constraints by leveraging the backup vault when the active vault's limit is reached.

### Root Cause

The `withdraw()` function lacks any mechanism to limit the amount withdrawn from the backup vault, even when the withdrawal from the active vault is capped by `maxWithdrawable`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `self.active.withdrawable()` for the active vault should return 1000e18
2. The backup vault must have a balance greater than zero for the specified ClosureId.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A withdrawal request (of `amount`) must exceed the `maxWithdrawable` amount of the active vault for the specified ClosureId.


### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a withdrawal request (suppose of `amount = 10_000e18`) that is larger than the `maxWithdrawable` limit of the active vault.
2. The `withdraw()` function checks the `available` balance in the active vault and respects the `maxWithdrawable` limit when withdrawing from it. Suppose `available = 1000e18` and `maxWithdrawable = 500e18`
3. The withdraw()` function sets `available = maxWithdrawable = 500e18`
4. The function then proceeds to withdraw `500e18` from the active vault while the remaining `amount - available` from the backup vault without any limit check.
5. If the backup vault has sufficient funds, the user successfully withdraws an amount exceeding the intended `maxWithdrawable` limit for the system.



### Impact

- Malicious actors or users exploiting this vulnerability could drain the entire balance of the backup vault in a single transaction, bypassing the intended rate limiting or safety mechanisms.
- If the backup vault holds significant funds, its unrestricted withdrawal could lead to substantial financial losses for the protocol  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Implement a withdrawal limit also for the backup vault similar to how `maxWithdrawable` is used for the active vault.  
- Implement a combined withdrawal limit from both active and backup vaults
