# The user was permanently locked due to depositing funds via the fund function.

# Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L116-L124

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IBGTExchanger
function fund(uint256 amount) external {
    bgtBalance += amount;
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
        bgtToken,
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
}
```

In the fund function, after the user deposits BGT tokens, the contract does not record the user's deposit entitlement (e.g., through an owed mapping or a separate deposit record), and no redemption mechanism is provided, resulting in the user's funds being permanently locked and unable to be withdrawn.

# Detail

The current fund function only transfers the BGT tokens deposited by the user to the contract address and updates the contract's total bgtBalance, but it does not record the individual user's deposit entitlement (e.g., it does not update owed[msg.sender] or maintain a separate deposit mapping).

When the user calls fund(amount), the contract performs the following actions:

bgtBalance += amount: Increases the contract's total BGT reserve.

TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom: Transfers amount of BGT from the user's wallet to the contract.

# Imapct

This vulnerability results in permanent loss of user funds: after a mistaken operation or an intentional deposit, the user is unable to retrieve the BGT tokens.

# Recommendation

Provide two remediation methods.

First method: Allow external users to deposit BGT tokens by adding individual user deposit records.

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IBGTExchanger
function fund(uint256 amount) external {
    bgtBalance += amount;
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
        bgtToken,
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
 +++owed[msg.sender] += amount;
}
```

Second method: Only allow the administrator to call the function to add token liquidity.

```solidity
/// @inheritdoc IBGTExchanger
function fund(uint256 amount) external {
 +++AdminLib.validateOwner();
    bgtBalance += amount;
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
        bgtToken,
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
}
```
