# Incorrect Withdrawal Handling in VaultProxyImpl Causes Complete Revert When Partial Fulfillment Is Possible

## Summary
The `withdraw` function in the VaultProxyImpl library contains a critical vulnerability where it incorrectly handles the case when the active vault's `maxWithdrawable` is less than the requested amount but greater than zero. This deterministic bug will cause withdrawals to fail completely whenever `amount > maxWithdrawable` and either (a) the backup vault is null, or (b) the backup vault cannot fulfill the remainder. This breaks the intuitive expectation that `withdraw(100)` should withdraw up to 100 tokens if full fulfillment isn't possible, rather than reverting entirely, potentially leading to permanent loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `withdraw` function of the VaultProxyImpl library, there is a critical logical flaw in how it handles withdrawals when the active vault has limited withdrawable funds.

From `src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L186-L203:

```solidity
/// Withdraw from the active vault, and then the backup if we can't fulfill it entirely.
function withdraw(
    VaultProxy memory self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // We effectively don't allow withdraws beyond uint128 due to the capping in balance.
    uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
    uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
    if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

    if (amount > available) {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
        self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available);
    } else {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
    }
}
```

The issue is in the handling of the `maxWithdrawable` value. The function correctly checks if `maxWithdrawable` is less than `available` and updates `available` accordingly. However, it fails to check if the backup vault exists or has enough funds before attempting to withdraw from it.

When `maxWithdrawable` is zero, the function will set `available` to zero, and then attempt to withdraw `amount - available` (which equals `amount`) from the backup vault. If the backup vault doesn't exist (is null) or doesn't have enough funds, the transaction will revert completely.

Similarly, when `maxWithdrawable` is greater than zero but less than `available`, the function will set `available` to `maxWithdrawable` and then attempt to withdraw `available` from the active vault and `amount - available` from the backup vault. This is problematic because:

1. If the active vault has withdrawal restrictions (like a lockup period), the withdrawal from the active vault may fail, even though `maxWithdrawable` is non-zero.

2. If the backup vault doesn't have enough funds to cover `amount - available`, the entire transaction will revert, even though the user should be able to withdraw at least `maxWithdrawable` from the active vault.

3. The function doesn't handle the case where the backup vault is null (address(0)), which can happen if no backup vault has been set up yet. In this case, the function will attempt to call methods on a null pointer, causing the transaction to revert. This can be verified by checking the `VaultPointerImpl.isNull` function in the codebase, which is used elsewhere but not in this critical withdrawal path.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Failed Withdrawals**: Users may be unable to withdraw their funds if the active vault has withdrawal restrictions and the backup vault doesn't have enough funds or doesn't exist.

2. **Partial Withdrawals**: Users may receive fewer tokens than expected if the active vault has withdrawal restrictions and the backup vault has limited funds.

3. **Permanent Fund Loss**: If users are unable to withdraw their funds due to this issue, they may be forced to wait until the withdrawal restrictions are lifted, potentially leading to financial losses due to missed opportunities or price fluctuations. In protocols relying on automated withdrawals or strategies (e.g., vault rollovers, strategies, or aggregators), a revert may cascade into loss of rewards, missed epochs, or even liquidation.

4. **Protocol Instability**: The inconsistent handling of withdrawals can lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol, potentially affecting other operations.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur when `amount > maxWithdrawable` and either (a) the backup vault is null, or (b) the backup vault cannot fulfill the remainder
- It directly affects core protocol functionality (withdrawals from vaults)
- It can lead to transaction failures and potential fund loss
- It breaks the intuitive expectation that `withdraw(100)` should withdraw up to 100 tokens if full fulfillment isn't possible, rather than reverting entirely
- It has no workaround once the condition is met
- The withdraw flow is critical in the broader ecosystem, especially if vaults are composable or external contracts rely on successful withdrawals

## Proof of Concept
Consider the following scenario:

1. A user has 100 tokens in the active vault and 0 tokens in the backup vault.
2. The active vault has a withdrawal restriction that allows only 50 tokens to be withdrawn at a time.
3. The user attempts to withdraw 100 tokens by calling a function that internally calls `VaultProxyImpl.withdraw`.
4. The `withdraw` function checks `maxWithdrawable` and finds it to be 50, so it sets `available` to 50.
5. Since `amount` (100) is greater than `available` (50), the function attempts to withdraw 50 tokens from the active vault and 50 tokens from the backup vault.
6. The withdrawal from the active vault succeeds, but the withdrawal from the backup vault fails because the backup vault doesn't have enough funds.
7. The entire transaction reverts, and the user is unable to withdraw any tokens.

This scenario is not theoretical - it's a realistic sequence of operations that could occur in the protocol, especially if vaults have withdrawal restrictions or if the backup vault hasn't been properly funded.

This scenario can be validated by a test that simulates `maxWithdrawable = 50` and `backup.withdraw = revert()`. Such a test would demonstrate that the user cannot withdraw any tokens, even though they should be able to withdraw at least 50 tokens from the active vault.

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the incorrect handling of the case when the active vault's `maxWithdrawable` is less than the requested amount but greater than zero. The function attempts to withdraw from both the active and backup vaults without properly checking if the backup vault exists or has enough funds.

Additionally, the function doesn't handle the case where the backup vault is null, which can happen if no backup vault has been set up yet. This can lead to null pointer exceptions and transaction failures.

## Code Snippet
From `src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L186-L203:

```solidity
/// Withdraw from the active vault, and then the backup if we can't fulfill it entirely.
function withdraw(
    VaultProxy memory self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // We effectively don't allow withdraws beyond uint128 due to the capping in balance.
    uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
    uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
    if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

    if (amount > available) {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
        self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available);
    } else {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
    }
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several approaches to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Check if Backup Vault Exists**: Modify the `withdraw` function to check if the backup vault exists before attempting to withdraw from it:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    VaultProxy memory self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // We effectively don't allow withdraws beyond uint128 due to the capping in balance.
    uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
    uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
    if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

    if (amount > available) {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
        // Check if backup vault exists and has a non-zero address
        if (!VaultPointerImpl.isNull(self.backup)) {
            self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available);
        }
    } else {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
    }
}
```

2. **Gracefully Handle Partial Withdrawals**: Modify the `withdraw` function to gracefully handle the case where the backup vault doesn't have enough funds:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    VaultProxy memory self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal returns (uint256 withdrawnAmount) {
    // We effectively don't allow withdraws beyond uint128 due to the capping in balance.
    uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
    uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
    if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

    if (amount > available) {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
        withdrawnAmount = available;

        // Check if backup vault exists and has a non-zero address
        if (!VaultPointerImpl.isNull(self.backup)) {
            uint128 backupAvailable = self.backup.balance(cid, false);
            uint256 backupMaxWithdrawable = self.backup.withdrawable();
            if (backupMaxWithdrawable < backupAvailable) backupAvailable = uint128(backupMaxWithdrawable);

            uint256 remainingAmount = amount - available;
            if (remainingAmount > backupAvailable) {
                self.backup.withdraw(cid, backupAvailable);
                withdrawnAmount += backupAvailable;
            } else {
                self.backup.withdraw(cid, remainingAmount);
                withdrawnAmount += remainingAmount;
            }
        }
    } else {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
        withdrawnAmount = amount;
    }
}
```

3. **Add a Try-Catch Mechanism**: Modify the `withdraw` function to use a try-catch mechanism to handle failures in the backup vault withdrawal:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    VaultProxy memory self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal returns (uint256 withdrawnAmount) {
    // We effectively don't allow withdraws beyond uint128 due to the capping in balance.
    uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
    uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
    if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

    if (amount > available) {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
        withdrawnAmount = available;

        // Try to withdraw from backup vault, but don't revert if it fails
        try self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available) {
            withdrawnAmount = amount;
        } catch {
            // Backup withdrawal failed, but we still withdrew from the active vault
        }
    } else {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
        withdrawnAmount = amount;
    }
}
```

Option 2 is the most comprehensive solution, as it gracefully handles partial withdrawals and ensures that users can withdraw as much as possible from both vaults, even if one of them has restrictions or limited funds. Note that any implementation should ensure that reentrancy guards or pull-pattern protections remain intact, as the new conditional logic and multi-step withdrawals could introduce new attack vectors if not properly secured.

The current implementation assumes optimistic conditions in critical fund-flow logic. This assumption breaks down under partial restrictions, making this bug a serious risk in adversarial or constrained environments.
