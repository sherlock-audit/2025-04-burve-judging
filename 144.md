# Incorrect logic of fee collection will let depositors miss fee rewards

### Summary

The incorrect logic of fee collection in **add()** of **Asset.sol** will cause depositors to miss collected fees as the contract will snapshot earnings before their deposit is recorded.

### Root Cause

**In `ValueFacet.addValueSingle()`:**

- You call `Closure.addEarnings()` and this will calculate `unexchangedPerBgtValueX128` and `earningsPerValueX128` for fee collection.
- You call `Store.assets().add()`, which first calls `collect()` on the Asset.
- `collect()` calculates fees based on `(closure checkpoint - asset checkpoint) * Asset.value`.
        But at this moment, the `Asset.value == 0` (new deposit isn't added yet).
        Thus, even if closure.earningsPerValueX128 is higher (fees have been accumulated), you collect zero fees because `asset.value = 0`.
        Then you update the checkpoints (`asset.earningsPerValueX128Check = closure.earningsPerValueX128`).
- `collect()` will add value to the asset after updating the checkpoints.

```solidity
- Asset.sol: 42
function add(
    AssetBook storage self,
    address recipient,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue
) internal {
    collect(self, recipient, cid); // This will collect no fess as asset.value is 0
    Asset storage a = self.assets[recipient][cid];
    require(value >= bgtValue, InsufficientValue(value, bgtValue));
    a.value += value;
    a.bgtValue += bgtValue;
}

- Asset.sol: 159
   // The checkpoints are updated to latest values in collect()
   a.earningsPerValueX128Check[i] = epvX128[i]; 
   a.unexchangedPerBgtValueX128Check[i] = unepbvX128[i];
```

**Later in `collectEarnings()`:**

- You again call `collect()` in `claimFees()`.
- But now, since the Asset checkpoint == Closure checkpoint, there is no delta, so no new fees are seen.
    Thus, no fees are ever collected for that value!

```solidity
- Asset.sol: 173
function claimFees(
    AssetBook storage self,
    address recipient,
    ClosureId cid
)
    internal
    returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory feeBalances, uint256 bgtBalance)
{
    collect(self, recipient, cid); // This will collect no fees as there is no delta
    Asset storage a = self.assets[recipient][cid];
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
        feeBalances[i] = a.collectedBalances[i];
        a.collectedBalances[i] = 0;
    }
    bgtBalance = a.bgtBalance;
    a.bgtBalance = 0;
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A depositor needs to call `addValueSingle()` to add value into a closure.
2. The Asset must have `value == 0` before deposit (first-time deposit or new CID).

### External Pre-conditions

1. Value must have been accumulated via external swaps or liquidity fees.

### Attack Path

1. A new user/depositor calls `addValueSingle()`.
2. `add()` on Asset calls `collect()` before the deposit updates Asset.value.
3. As `Asset.value == 0`, no fees are collected for the user.
4. The checkpoints are updated post-collect, meaning the depositor misses all prior earnings.
5. The user calls `collectEarnings()`.
6. It will call `collect()` on Asset, but there is no delta, so no fee will be collected.

### Impact

The new depositor suffers an approximate loss of all prior earned fees for the closure.
The protocol keeps the missed fees unclaimed, but it weakens fairness and damages user trust in fee distribution.
This will also impact bgt tokens balance in assets, so users will get less than they earned.

### PoC
Add the test function below to ValueFacet.t.sol.

```solidity
 function testAddSingleForValueAndCollectEarnings() public {
    // Step 1: Set up parameters
    address token = tokens[2];
    uint16 closureId = 0xF;
    uint128 value = 1e19;
    uint128 bgtValue = 0;

    // Step 2: Perform addSingleForValue actions
    valueFacet.addValueSingle(alice, closureId, value, bgtValue, token, 0);
    
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory collectedBalances, uint256 collectedBgt) = valueFacet.collectEarnings(alice, closureId);
    
    // Step 3: Get total fees collected
    uint totalFees = 0;
    for(uint i = 0 ; i < MAX_TOKENS ; i ++) {
        console.log("Collected Balance", collectedBalances[i]);
        totalFees += collectedBalances[i];
    }
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertGt(totalFees, 0, "It should collect some fees");
}
```

### Mitigation

Fix the fee collection logic inside `Asset.add()`.
