# Unregistered tokens can lead to incorrect `closureId` generation

### Summary

The lack of validation for token addresses in `newClosureId()` will cause a misrepresentation of token combinations for the protocol as an attacker or a user providing unregistered addresses will result in a ClosureId that incorrectly flags the presence of a token with index 0.

### Root Cause

In `closure/Id.sol`, the newClosureId() at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Id.sol#L12-20  function does not verify if the provided token addresses in the tokens array are registered within the TokenRegistry. It directly uses the return value of `tokenReg.tokenIdx[tokens[i]]`, which defaults to 0 for unregistered addresses.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The TokenRegistry must have registered at least two tokens with index 0 and 1 respectively.

Example:
 USDC 0x549943e04f40284185054145c6E4e9568C1D3241  with index 0
 WBTC 0x0555E30da8f98308EdB960aa94C0Db47230d2B9c with index 1
```
2. A user or another contract calls the `newClosureId()` function with a tokens array in input containing at least one address that has not been registered in the TokenRegistry.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user or a malicious actor calls the newClosureId() function with the following tokens [WBTC, WBERA] where WBTC is registered with index 1 while WBERA is unregistered.
2. For WBTC, `tokenReg.tokenIdx[WBTC]` returns index 1 from the registry.
3. The expression `1 << tokenReg.tokenIdx[WBTC]` evaluates `idx` to `1 << 1`, which is `0000000000000010` on 16 bits (2 in decimal)
4. At this point, being `cid` still zero, its new value will be 2
5. For the unregistered address, `tokenReg.tokenIdx[WBERA]` returns the default value of 0.
6. The expression `1 << tokenReg.tokenIdx[WBERA]` evaluates `idx` to `1 << 0`, which is `0000000000000001` on 16 bits.
7. Now the bitwise OR operation is being done between the old value of `cid = 2` and new `idx = 1` . The result is `0000000000000011`. 
9. The function returns a ClosureId of 3 that incorrectly indicates the presence of a token with index 0, even if the input array did not contain the registered token with index 0.

### Impact

The protocol logic relying on the ClosureId will be flawed. The ClosureId generated for a set of tokens containing unregistered addresses will falsely represent the presence of the token registered with index 0.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The newClosureId() function in closure/Id.sol should be modified to validate the registration status of each token address in the input tokens array. This can be easily achieved by modifying `tokenIdx` in `Token.sol` to use only non-zero values for registered tokens and leaving index 0 for unregistered token.
