# First deposit attack to first vertex deposits

## Summary
The `deposit` function allows closures with specific `cid`which are pools to deposit into the vertex to recieve shares , attaching shares to liquidity pool owners. However first depositor can deposit minimal amount to inflate his shares or can deflate shares buy depositing large amounts.

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
    function deposit(
        VaultE4626 storage self,
        VaultTemp memory temp,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        uint256 newlyAdding = FullMath.mulX128(
            temp.vars[1],
            temp.vars[3],
            true // Round up to round shares down.
        );
        uint256 totalAssets = temp.vars[0] + newlyAdding - temp.vars[2];

        uint256 discountedAmount = FullMath.mulX128(
            amount,
            temp.vars[3],
            false // Round down to round shares down.
        );
@>        uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
            ? discountedAmount
            : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
        self.shares[cid] += newShares;
        self.totalShares += newShares;
        temp.vars[1] += amount;
    }
```
As we can see in the pointer if `totalAssets == 0` user would recieve full shares for that vertex , So malicious user can deposit dust or minimal amount to the vertex to get or he can deflate the shares amount by depositing large amount to get high amount of shares.

## POC
Copy and paste in E625.t.sol
```solidity
    function testDaveDeposit() public {
        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(1);
        VaultTemp memory temp;
        vault.fetch(temp);
// deposit dust or high amount
        vault.deposit(temp, cid, 1e5);
        vault.commit(temp);
        assertEq(vault.balance(temp, cid, false), 1e10);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(this)), (1 << 128) - 1e10);
        assertGt(vault.totalVaultShares, 0);
        uint256 shares = vault.shares[cid];
        assertGt(shares, 0);
        assertEq(vault.totalShares, shares);
    }
```
## Impact
Unfair or insignificant shares shares would be recieved by other users

## Recommended Mitigation
First deposit should be minted to contract
