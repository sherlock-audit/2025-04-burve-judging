# Incorrect approval target causes all mints to revert during compounding

### Summary

Using approve(address(this), amount) will cause a complete denial of new liquidity mints for all users, as the Uniswap V3 pool contract will revert on transferFrom due to missing allowance.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L786-L788

### Root Cause

In Burve.sol:compoundV3Ranges() the calls:


SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(this), totalMint0);
SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(this), totalMint1);


grant allowance to the contract itself rather than to address(pool). Consequently, when pool.mint(...) executes token0.transferFrom(address(this), address(this), mint0), the spender (address(pool)) lacks an allowance and the call reverts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

compoundV3Ranges() must determine totalMint0 > 0 and totalMint1 > 0 (i.e., there are fees to compound).

A user invokes mint(...), which always calls compoundV3Ranges() first.



### External Pre-conditions

None — this issue is purely an internal allowance misconfiguration.



### Attack Path

User calls mint(recipient, mintNominalLiq, lowerLimit, upperLimit).

mint() invokes compoundV3Ranges().

Inside compoundV3Ranges(), after computing totalMint0 and totalMint1, the code does:


SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(this), totalMint0);
SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(this), totalMint1);
Next, it calls pool.mint(...), which tries:


token0.transferFrom(address(this), address(this), mint0);
Since address(pool) was never approved, transferFrom reverts with “ERC20: transfer amount exceeds allowance.”

The revert aborts compoundV3Ranges(), which bubbles up and aborts mint().

### Impact

All liquidity providers are unable to mint any new liquidity or receive share tokens, effectively freezing the protocol’s mint functionality.

### Mitigation

Approve the pool instead of the contract:

- SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(this), totalMint0);
- SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(this), totalMint1);
+ SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(pool), totalMint0);
+ SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(pool), totalMint1);
Revoke allowances after minting:

- SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(this), 0);
- SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(this), 0);
+ SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(pool), 0);
+ SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(pool), 0);
Add unit tests for compoundV3Ranges() to assert:

pool.mint() succeeds without allowance errors.

Allowances before and after are correctly set and cleared.
