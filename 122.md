# No slippage protection in mint() and burn() functions

## Description:
The `mint()` and `burn()` functions in the `Burve` contract lack comprehensive slippage protection mechanisms.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226
```solidity
    function mint(
        address recipient,
        uint128 mintNominalLiq,
        uint160 lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint160 upperSqrtPriceLimitX96
    )
        public
        withinSqrtPX96Limits(lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96, upperSqrtPriceLimitX96)
        returns (uint256 shares)
    {
        //...
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L350
```solidity
function burn(
        uint256 shares,
        uint160 lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint160 upperSqrtPriceLimitX96
    )
        external
        withinSqrtPX96Limits(lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96, upperSqrtPriceLimitX96)
    {
        // ...
```


While both functions includes a price limit check through the `withinSqrtPX96Limits()` modifier, it does not verify the minimum amount of shares a user expects to receive or the maximum amount of tokens they are willing to provide. 
The functions `mintIsland()` and `burnIsland()` also inherit this vulnerability.

Both functions use the current price (`sqrtRatioX96`) from the `slot0()` of the Uniswap V3 pool. An attacker can exploit this to manipulate the price in their favor using a flash loan or a sandwich attack.

## Attack path:
A user calls the `mint()` function to add liquidity, specifying price limits.
2. A malicious actor observes the transaction in the mempool and frontruns it by executing trades that manipulate the pool's token ratios while keeping the price within the specified limits.
3. When the user's transaction executes, the price is still within bounds, but the amount of tokens required for minting has changed unfavorably due to the attack.
4. The user ends up receiving fewer shares than expected or pays more tokens than they would have accepted, resulting in a loss of value.
5. The same attack vector applies to the `burn()` function, where the user may not receive the expected amount of tokens when burning their shares.

## Impact:
This vulnerability can lead to:
- Users receiving fewer shares than expected when adding liquidity through `mint()`.
- Users paying more tokens than they would have accepted when burning shares through `burn()`.

## Recommended Mitigation:
Modify the `mint()` and `burn()` functions to include parameters for slippage protection
