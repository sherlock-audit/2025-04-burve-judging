# `stationProxy.depositLP()` will revert blocking `mintIsland()`

### Summary

`mintIsland()` is called when the range is an island to provide liquidity to the island and deposit the island LP into the station proxy and from there earn BGT harvest rewards

### Root Cause

As seen below, the Kodiak pl is minted into the Burve contract (`address(this)`) and the then the [`stationProxy` is approved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L329) to spend the LP tokens from kodiak 

```sol
File: Burve/src/single/Burve.sol
296:     function mintIsland(
297:         address recipient,
298:         uint128 liq
299:     ) internal returns (uint256 mintIslandShares) {
300:         (uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
301: 
302:         (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = getAmountsForLiquidity(
303:             sqrtRatioX96,
304:             liq,
305:             island.lowerTick(),
306:             island.upperTick(),
307:             true
308:         );

////SNIP
329:         // approve transfer to the island
330:         SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(island), amount0);
331:         SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(island), amount1);
332: 
333:   @>    island.mint(mintShares, address(this));
334: 
335:         SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(island), 0);
336:         SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(island), 0);
337: 
338:         // deposit minted shares to the station proxy
339:         SafeERC20.forceApprove(island, address(stationProxy), mintShares);
340:   @>    stationProxy.depositLP(address(island), mintShares, recipient);
341:         SafeERC20.forceApprove(island, address(stationProxy), 0);
342: 
343:         return mintShares;
344:     }

```
The problem is that, the `stationProxy.depositLP()` function expects `recipient` to be the owner of the LP tokens but unfortunately the tokens currently belong to the Burve contract not the preferred recipient.

This is obvious from the `IStationProxy.sol` contract which is also in the scope of this audit, hence because `recipient` is not the current owner of the `lpToken` it will revert

```sol
File: Burve/src/single/IStationProxy.sol
20: 
21:     /// Called by a burve protocol to deposit LPtokens on behalf of a owner and accrue rewards for them.
22:     /// @param lpToken The token being deposited
23:     /// @param amount The amount of token to be deposited
24: @>  /// @param owner Who "owns" the lp tokens and who the rewards earned by the lpToken should be claimable by.
25:     function depositLP(address lpToken, uint256 amount, address owner) external;
26: 

```

### Impact

This leads to a Denial of service for users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider moving the `lpToken` from the Burve contract to the `lpToken` before the `stationProxy.depositLP()` call is executed
