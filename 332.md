# `removeValue` Execution Order Causes Loss of Yield for Liquidity Providers

### Summary

The [removeValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L190) process for liquidity providers executes in a vulnerable order, leading to loss of accrued yield during withdrawal. Specifically, `Store.assets().remove(...)` is called before the `trimAllBalances()` function inside `Closure.removeValue(...)`. Since trimming is responsible for harvesting and updating yield balances from the associated ERC-4626 vaults, any yield earned between the last update and withdrawal is not credited to the LP before their stake is removed.

This results in systematic underpayment to LPs and a silent leakage of protocol earnings.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect call order in the withdrawal logic:

```solidity
Closure storage c = Store.closure(cid);
Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue); // @audit: stake removed too early
uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory nominalReceives = c.removeValue(value, bgtValue); // balances trimmed here
```

In this pattern:

1. `Store.assets().remove(...)` unregisters the LP’s stake, but does not account for recent yield accumulation.
2. Only after that, `c.removeValue(...)` triggers `trimAllBalances(self)` inside `Closure`, which is responsible for harvesting ERC-4626 vault yield into internal accounting.

Inside `removeValue`:

```solidity
function removeValue(...) internal returns (...) {
    trimAllBalances(self); // yield harvested *after* LP stake is removed
    ...
    self.valueStaked -= value;
    ...
}
```

Since the LP’s recorded value has already been decremented before yield harvesting occurs, their share of the yield is not credited, resulting in loss of funds proportional to the pending yield.

This is particularly impactful in scenarios where:

* LPs withdraw after long idle periods.
* Vaults are highly productive (high APY).



### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

Attack path is not needed, it occurs in every `removeValue` call

### Impact

Liquidity providers may lose a portion of their earned yield when withdrawing, as yield accrued is not harvested before their stake is removed. This results in undercompensated withdrawals, silent value leakage, and potentially significant cumulative loss over time, especially in high-yield environments.


### Mitigation

The fix requires reordering the execution so that `removeValue()` is called before `assets().remove()`, ensuring yield is correctly harvested and distributed prior to LP deregistration.
