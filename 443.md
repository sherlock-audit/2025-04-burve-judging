# VertexImpl.withdraw doesn’t check vault’s maxWithdrawable vs. closure’s expectations.

### Summary

The `VertexImpl.withdraw` function does not verify that the underlying vault can actually fulfill a requested withdrawal amount before updating closure and reserve balances. Specifically, it omits checks against the vault’s withdrawable limit, allowing a closure or user to believe funds were removed when the vault may silently under‑deliver. This discrepancy can lead to mismatches between on‑chain accounting and actual token custody, enabling fund shortfalls or stuck state.

### Root Cause

1. Absent Vault Capacity Verification: `VertexImpl.withdraw` delegates withdrawal to `VaultProxy.withdraw` without first confirming `VaultProxy.withdrawable()` for the given `ClosureId`.

2. Blind Accounting Updates: The function immediately commits state changes based on requested amounts, rather than actual amounts received, assuming the vault honored the full withdrawal.

       function withdraw(
           Vertex storage self,
           ClosureId cid,
           uint256 amount,
           bool checkLock
       ) internal {
           require(!(checkLock && self._isLocked), VertexLocked(self.vid));
           VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
           vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
           vProxy.commit();
       }
Issue: No validation that `amount ≤ vProxy.withdrawable()` before calling `vProxy.withdraw`. Accounting updates assume full fulfillment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A Closure has previously deposited tokens into a vertex via `VertexImpl.deposit`.

2. The closure’s internal accounting (`balances`, `valueStaked`, etc.) has been updated to reflect those deposits.

### External Pre-conditions

The vault’s underlying balance for the closure’s `ClosureId` is lower than the requested withdrawal (due to external losses, prior untracked withdrawals, or stale state).

### Attack Path

1. Setup: A user or closure deposits 1,000 tokens into Vault X (via `VertexImpl.deposit`).

2. Vault Drained: An external actor removes tokens directly from Vault X (e.g., emergency admin withdraw), reducing closure’s real balance to 500.

3. User Withdrawal: Closure calls `Closure.withdraw` or `ValueFacet.removeValue`, which under the hood invokes `VertexImpl.withdraw(self, cid, amount, checkLock=true)` with `amount = 1,000`.

4. Silent Shortfall: `VaultProxy.withdraw` only withdraws up to `withdrawable()` (500), but `VertexImpl` and higher layers decrement closure accounting by the full 1,000.

5. State Mismatch: The internal `balances` and `valueStaked` now understate the actual vault holdings, permanently “losing” 500 tokens in protocol state.

### Impact

Closures (and ultimately users) may lose track of 50–100% of their deposited tokens, which become irretrievable.

### PoC

       // 1. User deposits 1000 tokens
       Store.vertex(vid).deposit(cid, 1000);

       // 2. Attacker or admin drains 500 directly from vault
       // (e.g., via emergency withdrawal)
       //   SafeERC20.forceApprove(token, vault, 500);
       //   vault.withdraw(500, address(attacker), address(attacker));

       // 3. Closure attempts full withdrawal of 1000
       VertexImpl.withdraw(self, cid, 1000, true);

       // vault.withdrawable() == 500, so only 500 returned
       // but internal state subtracts full 1000 => 500 shortfall unaccounted

### Mitigation

Pre‑Check withdrawable: In `VertexImpl.withdraw`, read `VaultProxy.withdrawable()` and assert `amount ≤ withdrawable`. Revert otherwise.
