# Invariant Break When Using addValue on Pre-Imbalanced Closure

# Invariant Break When Using addValue on Pre-Imbalanced Closure

### Summary

The Burve protocol allows users to increase value in a closure by calling `ValueFacet::addValue()`, which internally invokes `Closure::addValue()` to proportionally scale both the `target` and the individual `balance[i]`. While the mathematical scaling preserves proportional relationships, the system’s critical invariants depend on the absolute summed value of all tokens. If the closure is already slightly imbalanced before scaling, the proportional increase will also amplify the existing mismatch. This can push the total value beyond the system’s defined invariant boundaries, leading to a violation that makes the closure invalid and potentially unusable. Without recalculating and verifying the new target after scaling, the system risks silently breaking its fundamental safety guarantees.


### Root Cause

When a user calls `ValueFacet::addValue()`

```solidity
function addValue(  
    Closure storage self,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue
) internal returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory requiredBalances) {
    trimAllBalances(self); 
    uint256 scaleX128 = FullMath.mulDivX256(
        value,
        self.n * self.targetX128, 
        true
    );
    uint256 valueX128 = value << 128;
    self.targetX128 +=
        valueX128 / self.n + ((valueX128 % self.n) > 0 ? 1 : 0);  
    self.valueStaked += value;
    self.bgtValueStaked += bgtValue;  

    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
        if (!self.cid.contains(i)) continue;
        requiredBalances[i] = FullMath.mulX128(
            scaleX128,
            self.balances[i],
            true
        );
        self.setBalance(i, self.balances[i] + requiredBalances[i]); 
    }
}
```

the code computes `scaleX128` and proportionally scales the `target` and each `balance[i]`.

Mathematically, when \( t \) and \( x \) are scaled by factor \( k \), the new value \( $v_2$ \) becomes:

$$
v_1 = e t + 2t - \frac{(e t + t)^2}{x + e t}
$$

Simplifying:

$$
v_2 = e (k t) + 2 (k t) - \frac{(e (k t) + t)^2}{k x + e (k t)} 
= k (e t + 2t) - \frac{k^2 (e t + t)^2}{k (x + e t)} 
= k (e t + 2t) - k \cdot \frac{(e t + t)^2}{x + e t} 
= k \left(e t + 2t - \frac{(e t + t)^2}{x + e t}\right) 
= k \cdot v_1
$$

This means the value increases linearly, but any prior mismatch is also proportionally amplified.

The system must satisfy the invariant:

> The "value" of the closure (according to the formulas) can never be more than deMinimus × (number of tokens in the closure) from the target value of the pool times number of tokens in the closure.

For example, assume a closure with tokens A, B, and C:

Initially:

```solidity
v(A) = v(B) = target
v(C) = target + targetSlippageX128
```

The system holds:

$$
3 \cdot target - 3 \cdot deMinX128 \leq v(A) + v(B) + v(C) = 3 \cdot target + targetSlippageX128
$$

Now, calling `addValue` scales everything by 1.5:

```solidity
v(A) = v(B) = 1.5 * target
v(c) = 1.5 * (target + targetSlippageX128)
```

Resulting in:

$$
v(A) + v(B) + v(C) = 1.5 \cdot target + 1.5 \cdot target + 1.5 \cdot target + 1.5 \cdot targetSlippageX128 = 4.5 \cdot target + 1.5 \cdot targetSlippageX128
$$

However, the new target only allows:

$$
3 \cdot target \cdot 1.5 - 3 \cdot deMinX128 \leq v(A) + v(B) + v(C) \leq 1.5 \cdot target \cdot 3 + targetSlippageX128 = 4.5 \cdot target + targetSlippageX128
$$

The summed value now overshoots the right endpoint, violating the invariant.

Thus, when using `addValue`, any existing gap between \( $v(A) + v(B) + v(C) $\) and \( $3 \cdot target$ \) will be amplified by the scaling factor, increasing the risk of breaking the invariant.


### Attack Path

A user calls `addValue()` on a closure that already has a slight value deviation.
The scaling amplifies both the target and the balances proportionally, but also amplifies the mismatch, pushing the summed value beyond the system’s allowed limits.
Once the invariant is broken, future operations may revert or fail, locking the closure.

### Impact

Using `addValue` without adjusting for preexisting value mismatches can break critical system invariants, making the closure unusable and blocking all subsequent liquidity operations. 


### Mitigation

When calling `addValue`, the system must attempt to recalculate the target using the `t` function:

```solidity
  function t(  
        SearchParams memory searchParams,  
        uint256[] memory esX128,
        uint256[] memory xs,
        uint256 tX128
    ) internal pure returns (uint256 targetX128) 
```

If no suitable new target can be found, the system should immediately revert. This ensures that scaling operations do not break system invariants or destabilize the closure.
