# ERC4626 Vault in Burve does not generate yield due to missing lending/staking integration

### Summary

The `ERC4626VaultFacet` in Burve is expected to generate yield for depositors by depositing underlying assets into external lending & staking protocols. However, the current implementation simply uses the base `ERC4626` standard without integrating any lending, staking, or yield-generating logic.

Without any mechanism to generate yield, the vault serves only as a wrapper, and the share price remains static. This causes depositors to earn zero yield while expecting growth, misleading both integrators and users.

Here is the code snippet where new vaults are added

This is the code snippet which represents how the contracts are getting deployed in production. This represents entire functionality of staking/lending is missing in the protocol.

### Root Cause

Burve uses OpenZeppelin’s default [`[ERC4626.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol)`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol), which by itself does **not** implement any staking, lending, or compounding logic.

In typical yield vaults, after receiving assets, the vault must:

- Stake/lend to external protocols inside `afterDeposit()`
- Withdraw from those protocols in `beforeWithdraw()`
- Periodically harvest and compound rewards (e.g., via `harvest()`)

Since Burve does **none** of these steps, user assets sit idle in the vault, earning nothing eventually making using of Vaults useless and it goes against the Burve documentation

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

- Users earn zero yield despite depositing into a “vault”.
- Protocol reputation is affected due to unmet expectations.
- Misleads integrators expecting a compliant `ERC4626` yield source.

### PoC

  1. User deposits tokens into the Pool by calling valueFacet.addValue(). These tokens are sent into the vault
2. No swapping done, hence the expectation is tokens in the vault will generate the yield.
3. Users will receive no additional yield when tokens are removed by calling valueFacet.removeValue().
 
### Mitigation

Extend burve contracts to include yield generation functions integrated with the given Vaults 

- `afterDeposit()`,`beforeWithdraw()`,`harvest()`

Without these functions, the vault remains non-functional for yield generation.
