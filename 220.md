# Mixed new and External Facet Injection

### Summary

In the `SimplexDiamond` contract, facets are mixed between those deployed using the `new` keyword within the constructor (e.g., `new DiamondCutFacet()`) and those injected externally via the constructor (e.g., `facets.valueFacet`). This inconsistency could lead to potential issues in gas costs, determinism of facet addresses, and upgradeability.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the inconsistent approach to deploying facets. Some facets are instantiated directly using the `new` keyword, leading to new deployments on every contract deployment. In contrast, other facets are injected through the constructor, allowing for reusability and reducing deployment costs.  This happens in the contructor in `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L28`

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract constructor accepts an object `BurveFacets` containing external facet addresses (e.g., `valueFacet`, `swapFacet`, etc.).

2. Some facets are instantiated directly within the constructor (e.g., `new DiamondCutFacet()`).

3. The facets instantiated with `new` have no deterministic address and will change with each deployment, whereas the externally injected facets will have fixed addresses, making it easier to predict the deployment outcome and maintain the state of the contract.

4. Some of these facets may have overlapping function selectors, and relying on multiple instantiations may cause unexpected behaviors in facet resolution.



### External Pre-conditions

1. External facets are expected to be passed when the contract is deployed. These external facets are likely to be pre-deployed contracts that are expected to remain consistent over time.

2. The contract is used in a diamond proxy pattern, where facet upgrades are performed without redeploying the entire contract. The proper management of facet addresses is critical for upgradeability and modularity.

3. Gas optimization is a primary concern, and deploying new facets with `new` each time can lead to unnecessary costs.

### Attack Path

1. Non-Deterministic Facet Addresses: The use of `new` creates facets that will have different addresses on each deployment. This lack of deterministic addresses could lead to inconsistency when interacting with other parts of the system that rely on fixed facet addresses.

2. Facet Duplication: If different deployments result in the creation of duplicate facets with different addresses, there could be complications with message routing and incorrect facet logic resolution.

3. Increased Gas Cost: Deploying facets each time using `new` increases deployment and transaction costs, as compared to reusing pre-deployed contracts.

### Impact

- Gas Inefficiency: Every deployment of the contract incurs additional gas costs for deploying new facets, which can increase the overall cost of deployment.

- Non-Determinism: If facets are deployed using `new`, their addresses will not be known until deployment, leading to difficulty in predicting the exact state and configuration of the contract.

- Upgradeability Complications: Facet addresses are less predictable, making it difficult to upgrade or interact with the contract in a modular way. The contract may fail to maintain consistency across deployments, affecting future upgrades or interactions.

### Mitigation

1. Use External Facet Injection Consistently: Where feasible, always inject facets externally rather than creating new instances within the constructor. This ensures deterministic addresses and reduces gas costs.

2. Pre-deploy Facets: Ensure that facets are deployed in a fixed, predictable manner, such as by using fixed addresses. External facet addresses should be passed to the constructor for all facets.

3. Refactor Constructor: Refactor the constructor to only accept external facet addresses and remove the `new` instantiation of facets. This will ensure that only pre-deployed contracts are used, optimizing deployment costs and improving predictability.

4. Gas Optimization: Always ensure that facets are deployed efficiently. By reusing pre-deployed contracts and avoiding unnecessary deployments, gas costs will be reduced.

By adopting these mitigations, the contract can become more gas-efficient, predictable, and easier to maintain during future upgrades.
