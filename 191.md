# Single-Pool Blindly Trusts Spot Price Allowing Flash-Loan Price Manipulation and LP Share Dilution

## Brief

The single-pool implementation in [Burve.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L110) relies exclusively on the instantaneous spot-price returned by the underlying Uniswap V3 pool (`pool.slot0()`).

Because no TWAP, freshness check, or external oracle is consulted, any actor who can momentarily move that spot-price (e.g. with a flash-loan swap in the same V3 pool) can mint Burve LP shares against a manipulated valuation, receiving an out-sized ownership claim while depositing fewer real assets.

This manipulation–mint cycle is permissionless, capital-efficient, and repeatable, allowing adversaries to drain value from honest liquidity providers and destabilise the protocol over time.

## Details

### 1. Price is read once and blindly trusted

Every function that needs a price pulls it from `slot0()` and discards the accompanying metadata:

```solidity
// Burve.sol
(uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();

```

Typical usages:

```solidity
// ① access-control wrapper
modifier withinSqrtPX96Limits(uint160 lower, uint160 upper) {
    (uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
    if (sqrtRatioX96 < lower || sqrtRatioX96 > upper)
        revert SqrtPriceX96OverLimit(sqrtRatioX96, lower, upper);
    _;                    // lower/upper are supplied by the *caller*
}

// ② share minting path
function mint(...) public withinSqrtPX96Limits(lower, upper) {
    compoundV3Ranges();                    // uses the same spot price again
    ...
}

// ③ fee-compounding
function compoundV3Ranges() internal {
    collectV3Fees();
    (uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
    ...
}

```

No call to `observe()` (TWAP), no timestamp/observation checks, and the bounds enforced by the modifier are user-provided, meaning an attacker can simply pass extremely wide limits.

### 2. Why a moved spot-price lets an attacker under-pay

Shares are minted proportionally to the *declared* “nominal liquidity” (`mintNominalLiq`), not to the market value of the tokens transferred:

```solidity
// after the first mint
shares = FullMath.mulDiv(mintNominalLiq, totalShares, totalNominalLiq);

```

The token amounts the user must deliver for a given `mintNominalLiq` are derived from the current spot price:

```solidity
(amount0Owed, amount1Owed) =
      LiquidityAmounts.getAmountsForLiquidity(
          sqrtRatioX96, range.lower, range.upper, liqInRange, /*roundUp*/ true
      );

```

If an attacker skews `sqrtRatioX96` downward by 5 %, the formula demands ≈5 % less of token 0 (or more of token 1, depending on the range).

Because `shares` are calculated before the price corrects, the attacker receives the full ownership entitlement while having deposited under-priced assets.

Once arbitrage restores the real price, the attacker’s shares map to a larger claim on pool assets, diluting everyone else.

### 3. Fee compounding amplifies the damage

`mint()` calls `compoundV3Ranges()` up-front.

That routine:

1. collects all unpaid swap fees,
2. converts them to *additional* `nominal` liquidity **using the same spot price**,
3. increases `totalNominalLiq`.

During the manipulated block the protocol therefore mis-prices both the user deposit **and** its own treasury of fees, further distorting the share ledger to the attacker’s advantage.

### 4. Concrete attack flow (single transaction)

1. Flash-borrow token A / token B.
2. Execute a large `swap()` in the target Uniswap V3 pool to push `sqrtRatioX96` beyond a convenient tick.
3. Immediately call `Burve.mint(recipient, L, 0, type(uint160).max)` — the modifier passes because the attacker’s limits surround the manipulated price.
4. Pay the (under-valued) `amount0Owed/amount1Owed` during the mint callback.
5. Swap back in the V3 pool to restore the original price and repay the flash loan.
6. Withdraw or wait: the attacker now owns more pool value than was deposited.

Because capital is provided by the flash loan, the cost is limited to swap fees and the loan premium, while the upside scales with pool TVL. Repeating the sequence extracts value until LPs exit or the contract is patched.

## Impact

By momentarily moving the spot-price, an attacker can mint Burve LP shares at a discount, capturing an oversized fraction of the pool’s assets and directly diluting all existing liquidity providers.

The attack is executable in a single flash-loan transaction, needs no privileged roles, and can be repeated indefinitely.
