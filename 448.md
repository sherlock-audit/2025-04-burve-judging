# Inconsistent Fee Calculation in Closure: `addValue` vs. `addTokenForValue`


### Summary  
The `Closure` contract calculates fees inconsistently between the `addValueSingle` and `addTokenForValue` functions. `addTokenForValue` charges fees on the entire input amount, while `addValueSingle` charges fees only on the portion of value that balances the pool. This can lead to users being **overcharged** when using `addTokenForValue`, especially in pools with fewer tokens.

### Root Cause  
The issue lies in how the `tax` is calculated in the two functions:

- **In `addTokenForValue`**, the fee is applied to the **entire input amount** before any value-balancing logic:

  ```solidity
  tax = FullMath.mulX128(amount, self.baseFeeX128, true);
  amount -= tax;
  ```
[Closure.addTokenForValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L295-L295)

- **In `addValueSingle`**, the fee is applied only to the **unbalanced portion** of the required amount:

  ```solidity
  uint256 untaxedRequired = finalAmount - fairVBalance;
  taxedRequired = UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp(
      untaxedRequired << 128,
      ONEX128 - self.baseFeeX128
  );
  tax = taxedRequired - untaxedRequired;
  ```
[Closure.addValueSingle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L147-L147)


This means:

- `addTokenForValue` charges a fee on the **full amount**
- `addValueSingle` charges a fee only on the **amount needed to balance the pool**

In balanced pools (e.g., stablecoin pools), this difference can be **significant**, with `addTokenForValue` potentially charging **up to 1/3 more** in fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions  
1. A `Closure` contract exists with a non-zero `baseFeeX128`  
2. The contract manages a pool with 2 or more tokens (vertices)

### External Pre-conditions  
1. A user chooses to add liquidity using either `addTokenForValue` or `addValueSingle`

### Attack Path  
1. The user calls `addTokenForValue`:
   - Fee is charged on the **entire input**
   - User pays **higher** fee

2. The user calls `addValueSingle`:
   - Fee is charged **only** on the amount needed to balance the pool
   - User pays a **lower** fee

### Impact  
Users using `addTokenForValue` are **unfairly overcharged** compared to those using `addValueSingle`, especially in pools with a small number of tokens.  
For example, in a **3-token pool**, a user:

- using `addTokenForValue` pays fees on ~**the total value**  
- using `addValueSingle` pays fees only on the value needed to balance the remaining **2/3 of the pool**

This difference in fee treatment is **non-trivial**. The code comment describing this as a "slight overcharge" is **misleading**, as the overcharge can be **substantial**.

### PoC (optional)  
N/A

### Mitigation (optional)  
- **Standardize fee logic**: Align the `addTokenForValue` fee calculation with `addValueSingle` by only charging on the value needed to balance the pool
