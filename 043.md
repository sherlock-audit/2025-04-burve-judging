# Double Withdrawal Vulnerability via backupEx Aggregation Logic in BGTExchanger

### Summary

The BGTExchanger contract supports a backupEx mechanism to aggregate owed BGT token balances from a previous version or auxiliary exchanger. While getOwed() correctly sums the balances from both the main and backup contract, the withdrawn tracking is only maintained in the main contract. As a result, a malicious user can withdraw their full balance from both the main and backup contracts independently—effectively double claiming BGT tokens and draining protocol reserves

### Root Cause

```solidity
function getOwed(address caller) public view returns (uint256 _owed) {
    _owed = owed[caller];
    if (address(backupEx) != address(0)) {
        _owed += backupEx.getOwed(caller);
    }
    _owed -= withdrawn[caller];
}
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L72
```
The getOwed() function sums both this.owed and backupEx.getOwed.

However, the withdrawn amount is only tracked locally:
```solidity
withdrawn[msg.sender] += bgtAmount; // withdrawn[msg.sender] should also be updated in the backup contract, but it is not
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L85
```
This allows a user to withdraw more than their combined total across both contracts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- owed[user] > 0 in the current contract
- backupEx.getOwed(user) > 0 in the backup contract
- withdrawn[user] is tracked only in the current contract

### External Pre-conditions

- backupEx is configured using setBackup()
- Both the current and backup exchangers allow the user to call withdraw()
- No centralized reconciliation is performed between the two contracts

### Attack Path

1. User has owed[user] = 1000 in the current contract
   backupEx.getOwed(user) = 1000
2. In the current contract:
  - getOwed(user) returns 2000 (sum of both)
  - User calls withdraw(1500) → success
  - withdrawn[user] = 1500 locally
  - backup's withdrawn[msg.sender] is still 0 (not updated)
3. In the backup contract:
  - It knows nothing about the 1500 withdrawn
  - getOwed(user) in backup = 1000
  - User calls withdraw(1000) → success
4. Total BGT withdrawn = 2500, while entitlement was only 2000

### Impact

Users can manipulate getOwed()'s cross-contract aggregation logic to withdraw more BGT than they are actually owed, by drawing from both the current and backup exchanger. This leads to financial loss for the protocol, accounting inconsistencies, and makes the system unsafe for modular upgrades or migrations involving backup contracts

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent double withdrawals, either remove backupEx aggregation from getOwed() or require withdrawals to be handled independently by each contract.
