# Withdraw Failure Due to Overestimation with Rounding Up in Reserve

# Withdraw Failure Due to Overestimation with Rounding Up in Reserve

### Summary

In the `Reserve::withdraw` function, the system calculates the available balance using **rounding up** when calling `vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true)`. This creates a situation where the sum of individual users’ fee withdrawals exceeds the actual vault balance. As a result, when the last user attempts to withdraw their share, the underlying ERC-4626 `withdraw()` call fails with a revert due to insufficient balance, effectively locking their funds permanently.


### Root Cause

The issue appears here:

```solidity
    function withdraw(
        VertexId vid,
        uint256 shares
    ) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
        Reserve storage reserve = Store.reserve();
        uint8 idx = vid.idx();
        if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
        VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
@>      uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);  
        amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
        vProxy.withdraw(RESERVEID, amount);
        vProxy.commit();
        reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;
    }
```

The system calculates the available balance using **rounding up** when calling `vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true)`.


Users claim their earnings through `ValueFacet::collectEarnings`:

```solidity
    function collectEarnings(
        address recipient,
        uint16 closureId
    )
        external
        returns (
            uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory collectedBalances,
            uint256 collectedBgt
        )
    {
        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(closureId);
        // Catch up on rehypothecation gains before we claim fees.
        Store.closure(cid).trimAllBalances();
        uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory collectedShares;
@>      (collectedShares, collectedBgt) = Store.assets().claimFees(
            msg.sender,
            cid
        );
        if (collectedBgt > 0)
            IBGTExchanger(Store.simplex().bgtEx).withdraw(
                recipient,
                collectedBgt
            );
        TokenRegistry storage tokenReg = Store.tokenRegistry();
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
            if (collectedShares[i] > 0) {
                VertexId vid = VertexLib.newId(i);
                // Real amounts.
                collectedBalances[i] = ReserveLib.withdraw(
                    vid,
                    collectedShares[i]
                );
                TransferHelper.safeTransfer(
                    tokenReg.tokens[i],
                    recipient,
                    collectedBalances[i]
                );
            }
        }
    }
```

The key point is that `claimFees` always withdraws **all** the fees — users cannot selectively claim only part.

```solidity
function claimFees(
    AssetBook storage self,
    address recipient,
    ClosureId cid
)
    internal
    returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory feeBalances, uint256 bgtBalance)
{
    collect(self, recipient, cid);
    Asset storage a = self.assets[recipient][cid];
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
        feeBalances[i] = a.collectedBalances[i];
        a.collectedBalances[i] = 0;
    }
    bgtBalance = a.bgtBalance;
    a.bgtBalance = 0;
}
```

This creates a trap: even if **1 wei** is overestimated, the last user’s withdraw call will revert.


### Attack Path

Example:

1. The vault’s real withdrawable balance is **109.1**.
2. `vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true)` rounds this up → **110**.
3. Three users (A, B, C) have shares:
    A = 20%, B = 20%, C = 60%.
4. Each withdraws:

    * A: `110 * 20% = 22` → successfully withdraws 22, remaining balance = 109.1 − 22 = 87.1.
    * B: `110 * 20% = 22` → successfully withdraws 22, remaining balance = 87.1 − 22 = 65.1.
    * C: `110 * 60% = 66` → tries to withdraw 66, but vault only has **65.1**, so the ERC-4626 `withdraw(66, …)` **reverts**, locking C’s funds forever.

In fact, in any multi-user case, as long as two or more users’ calculations do not hit clean integer splits (i.e., no decimal part), the last user’s fees become **permanently locked**. With many users, this becomes increasingly likely.

### Impact

Even a small rounding overestimation can cause the last claimant’s funds to be permanently locked.


### Mitigation

The simplest fix is to change the balance calculation to **round down** to ensure:

> total distributable shares ≤ actual available balance.

Specifically, replace:

```diff
- uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
+ uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, false);
```

This ensures no user is blocked by insufficient vault balance and preserves the system’s integrity under rounding edge cases.
