# StationProxy Migration Requires Token Re‑approval

### Summary

The `migrateStationProxy` function allows the contract owner to instruct the user’s existing `StationProxy` to migrate their deposited LP tokens to a new proxy instance. However, there is no on‑chain check or guidance ensuring that individual users have granted the necessary ERC20 approvals (via approve) to the new `StationProxy` before migration. If a user has not re‑approved the new proxy, their tokens (and future yield) will become effectively “orphaned” in the old proxy: the new proxy cannot pull them, and the old proxy will no longer manage them after migration.

       function migrateStationProxy(IStationProxy newStationProxy) external {
           AdminLib.validateOwner();

           if (address(stationProxy) == address(newStationProxy)) {
               revert MigrateToSameStationProxy();
           }

           emit MigrateStationProxy(stationProxy, newStationProxy);

           stationProxy.migrate(newStationProxy);
           stationProxy = newStationProxy;
       }

This migration sequence lacks any per‑user allowance verification for `newStationProxy` pulling LP tokens from users.

### Root Cause

Missing Approval Verification:
The migration logic assumes that LP token allowances for the new proxy have already been set by each user. There is no mechanism to verify approvals or to prompt users to set them prior to migration.

One‑time Global Migration:
Migration is initiated unilaterally by the contract owner for all users at once, rather than on a per‑user basis. Users who are not actively monitoring migration may lose access to their deposited tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The contract owner calls `migrateStationProxy(newProxy)`.

2. The old `stationProxy` has stored user LP‑token deposits under allowances granted to it.

### External Pre-conditions

Individual users must have previously executed `approve(oldProxy, amount)` on the LP token contracts, but not necessarily `approve(newProxy, amount)`.

### Attack Path

1. Owner Initiates Migration
Owner calls `migrateStationProxy(newProxy)`. This triggers:

       stationProxy.migrate(newProxy);
       stationProxy = newProxy;

2. User Leaves Approvals Unchanged
Many users have not approved the new proxy contract. As a result, when the new proxy attempts to `transferFrom(...)` on behalf of those users, the call will revert or simply fail, preventing the user's LP tokens from being migrated and future earnings from being credited.

3. Orphaned Deposits
The old proxy relinquishes control; the new proxy cannot manage those deposits. Users are unable to withdraw or claim rewards from their stuck LP positions.

### Impact

Users’ LP tokens and accrued rewards can become permanently inaccessible ("orphaned") if they have not set approvals for the new proxy. Tokens remain locked in the vault with no withdrawal path. Loss is user‑specific but could affect a large subset of inactive or unaware depositors.

### PoC

1. Setup

- User Alice deposits 1,000 LP tokens into StationProxy v1 by having approved `approve(proxyV1, 1000)`.

2. No Re‑approval

- Alice never calls approve(proxyV2, 1000).

3. Migration

- Owner calls `migrateStationProxy(proxyV2)`.

- `StationProxyV1.migrate(proxyV2)` moves internal ledger entries but does not physically transfer tokens.

- `stationProxy` now points to `proxyV2`.

4. Failed Withdrawal

- Alice calls `harvest()` on `proxyV2`.

- `proxyV2` attempts `lpToken.transferFrom(Alice, proxyV2, owedAmount)` but reverts due to zero allowance.

- Alice’s LP tokens cannot be redeemed or withdrawn from anywhere.
