# Incorrect Fee Collection Order in `ValueFacet.removeValue`

### Summary

In `ValueFacet.removeValue` , fees are collected from the asset book before the closure is trimmed, causing stale checkpoints to underpay earnings to LPs.

### Root Cause

In `ValueFacet.removeValue` (and `removeValueSingle`), the protocol first calls:

```solidity
Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
```

which internally invokes `AssetBook.remove` → `AssetBook.collect`, collecting fees **before** the closure itself has been trimmed of its newly accrued earnings. Only after that does `Closure.removeValue` call `trimAllBalances`. As a result, the user’s fee collection uses stale checkpoints, then their principal is reduced, and the subsequent trimming of the closure’s balances never gets properly credited to that user.

```solidity
    function removeValue(
        address recipient,
        uint16 _closureId,
        uint128 value,
        uint128 bgtValue
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory receivedBalances)
    {
        if (value == 0) revert DeMinimisDeposit();
        require(bgtValue <= value, InsufficientValueForBgt(value, bgtValue));
        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_closureId);
        Closure storage c = Store.closure(cid);
@>        Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
@>        uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory nominalReceives = c.removeValue(
            value,
            bgtValue
        );
        // ...
    }
```

The root cause is the wrong ordering of operations in `removeValue` :

  1. **Asset removal** (`AssetBook::remove` which calls `AssetBook::collect`) reads **old** `earningsPerValueX128` & `bgtPerBgtValueX128`.
  2. **Closure trimming** (`c.removeValue`) then updates the closure’s earnings checkpoints.
  3. The user’s principal is already reduced, so those newly recorded earnings are never included in that removal’s fee collection.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user holds a non-zero asset position in a given closure (`a.value > 0`).
2. The closure has unclaimed earnings accrued since the last trim.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The user calls `ValueFacet.removeValue(...)` or `removeValueSingle(...)` on that same closure.

### Attack Path

1. Fee accrual: Trading activity generates fees for the closure, but no trim has occurred yet.
2. Value remove: User calls `removeValue`:

   * `AssetBook.collect` collects using stale checkpoints (no new fees).
   * User’s principal is reduced.
   * `Closure.removeValue` then trims and updates checkpoints but it is too late.

### Impact

Underpayment of fees: Users receive less than entitled resulting to loss of funds for the LPs.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reorder operations so the closure is trimmed *before* asset removal. For example:

```diff
- Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
- uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory nominalReceives = c.removeValue(value, bgtValue);
+ uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory nominalReceives = c.removeValue(value, bgtValue);
+ Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
```
