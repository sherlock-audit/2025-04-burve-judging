# The calculation of `compoundedNominalLiq` is incorrect.

### Summary

In the contract `Burve.sol`, the function `getCompoundAmountsPerUnitNominalLiqX64()` calculates the token amounts needed for compounding one X64 unit of nominal liquidity in the v3 ranges. However, the calculation result `amount0InUnitLiqX64` and `amount1InUnitLiqX64` are incorrect, because the the sum of `distX96[i]` for i from `0` to `distX96.length - 1` is less than the value of `1<<96` due to the skip of the distX96[i] when `range.isIsland()` is true. 

This will lead to the value of `compoundedNominalLiq` will be larger than the actual value, which leads to the value of `totalNominalLiq` to be larger than the actual value.

            amount1InUnitLiqX64 += range1InUnitLiqX64;
```

### Root Cause

The function `getCompoundAmountsPerUnitNominalLiqX64()` calculates the token amounts needed for compounding one X64 unit of nominal liquidity in the v3 ranges. However, the calculation result `amount0InUnitLiqX64` and `amount1InUnitLiqX64` are incorrect, because the the sum of `distX96[i]` for i from `0` to `distX96.length - 1` is less than the value of `1<<96` due to the skip of the distX96[i] when `range.isIsland()` is true. 

[Burve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L940-L954)

```solidity
            uint128 liqInRangeX64 = uint128(
                shift96(uint256(UNIT_NOMINAL_LIQ_X64) * distX96[i], true)
            );
            (
                uint256 range0InUnitLiqX64,
                uint256 range1InUnitLiqX64
            ) = getAmountsForLiquidity(
                    sqrtRatioX96,
                    liqInRangeX64,
                    range.lower,
                    range.upper,
                    true
                );
            amount0InUnitLiqX64 += range0InUnitLiqX64;
            amount1InUnitLiqX64 += range1InUnitLiqX64;
```


The further proof is as follows:
1. The parameter `liqInRange` used in the function `mintIsland`, indicates that the value of `distX96[i]` is not zero when `range.isIsland()` is true. 

[Burve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L242-L253)

```solidity
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
            uint128 liqInRange = uint128(
                shift96(uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true)
            );

            if (liqInRange == 0) {
                continue;
            }

            TickRange memory range = ranges[i];
            if (range.isIsland()) {
                islandShares = mintIsland(recipient, liqInRange);
```

2. The initialization of `distX96` in the consturctor indicates that the sum of `distX96[i]` for i from `0` to `distX96.length - 1` is equal to the value of `1<<96` when the `distX96[i]` is counted in when `range.isIsland()` is true.

[Burve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L192-L200)

```solidity
        uint256 sum = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _weights.length; ++i) {
            sum += _weights[i];
        }

        // calculate distribution for each weighted position
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _weights.length; ++i) {
            distX96.push((_weights[i] << 96) / sum);
        }
```


Thus, it is sure that the the sum of `distX96[i]` for i from `0` to `distX96.length - 1` is less than the value of `1<<96` due to the skip of the distX96[i] when `range.isIsland()` is true.

However, this will not lead to dos of insufficient balances, since the amount0 and amount1 needed for `compoundLiq` will not be counted in when `range.isIsland()` is true too. Thus, the impact is the incorrect calculation of the token amounts needed for compounding one X64 unit of nominal liquidity in the v3 ranges. And the value of `amount0InUnitLiqX64` and `amount1InUnitLiqX64` will be smaller than the actual value. 

Thus, the value of `compoundedNominalLiq` will be larger than the actual value, which leads to the value of `totalNominalLiq` to be larger than the actual value. 


### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract has a range which the `range.isIsland()` is true.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

A malicious user could invest in the Burve contract early and wait when the fees are collected and reinvest to the pool, the value of `compoundedNominalLiq` will be larger than the actual value, which leads to the value of `totalNominalLiq` to be larger and larger as the time goes by. 

When the deviation of the `totalNominalLiq` is large enough, the user can burn the shares invested and get more tokens than he should be able to get.

### Impact

Every time when the fees are collected and reinvest to the pool, the value of `compoundedNominalLiq` will be larger than the actual value, which leads to the value of `totalNominalLiq` to be larger and larger as the time goes by.

Thus, the early investors of the Burve will be able to get more tokens than they should be able to get. Meanwhile, the later investors will get less tokens than they should be able to get.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Revise the logic of the function `getCompoundAmountsPerUnitNominalLiqX64()` to make the calculation result of the token amounts needed for compounding one X64 unit of nominal liquidity in the v3 ranges correct.
