# Zero Tax Exploitation in Withdrawal Function

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the `removeValueSingle()` function where users can withdraw their full balance without paying any protocol tax due to an uninitialized variable being used in a calculation. This results in direct revenue loss for the protocol.

### Root Cause

In `ValueFacet.sol:235`, the `removedBalance` variable is used in a tax calculation before it's assigned a value:

[Line 235](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L235)

```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
// removedBalance is only defined later at line 241
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;
```

Since `removedBalance` is uninitialized, it defaults to `0`, resulting in no tax being collected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- User must have previously added value to a specific `closureId` through `addValue()`, `addValueSingle()`, or `addSingleForValue()` functions


### External Pre-conditions

- None required

### Attack Path

1. User calls `removeValueSingle(recipient, _closureId, value, bgtValue, token, minReceive)`
2. Contract calculates `removedNominal` and `nominalTax` correctly
3. Contract converts to `realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false)`
4. **Critical error occurs**: `realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal)`
   - At this point, `removedBalance` is uninitialized (= 0)
   - Therefore, `realTax` equals 0 regardless of intended tax amount
5. Contract calls `c.addEarnings(vid, 0)`, adding zero earnings to the closure
6. `removedBalance` is set to `realRemoved - 0` = `realRemoved` (full amount)
7. User receives 100% of their withdrawal with no tax deducted


### Impact

- **Protocol Revenue Loss**: The protocol loses intended tax revenue on all withdrawals using this function
- **Financial Advantage**: Users of this function gain an unfair advantage by avoiding taxes
- **Economic Imbalance**: Creates inconsistency between different withdrawal methods, potentially leading to exploitation
- **Long-term Risk**: If exploited systematically, could significantly impact protocol sustainability
