# Incorrect Use of Caret Operator in FullMath Library Leads to Severe Calculation Errors


## Summary
The FullMath library incorrectly uses the caret operator (^) as an exponentiation operator, when in Solidity it is actually a bitwise XOR operator. This leads to severe calculation errors that can affect token conversions, pricing, and other critical mathematical operations throughout the protocol.

## Vulnerability Details
In the FullMath.sol library, (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L92,#L177) there are instances where the caret operator (^) is used incorrectly, specifically in lines 92 and 177:

```solidity
// Line 92 in FullMath.sol
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;

// Line 177 in FullMath.sol
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;
```

The developer intended to square the value `(3 * denominator)`, but in Solidity, the `^` operator performs a bitwise XOR operation, not exponentiation. The correct way to square a number in Solidity is to multiply it by itself: `(3 * denominator) * (3 * denominator)`.

This error leads to drastically incorrect results. For example:
- `(3 * 10) ^ 2` evaluates to `28` (bitwise XOR)
- `(3 * 10) * (3 * 10)` evaluates to `900` (correct exponentiation)

The error percentage increases with larger denominators, reaching nearly 100% for denominators of 1000 or more.

## Impact
This vulnerability has severe implications for the protocol:

1. **Incorrect Token Conversions**: The FullMath library is used throughout the protocol for token conversions, particularly in the adjustor contracts. Incorrect calculations can lead to users receiving significantly more or less tokens than they should.

2. **Extreme Precision Loss**: The error percentage can be as high as 9996 basis points (99.96%), meaning calculations are almost completely wrong for larger values.

3. **Financial Impact**: When applied to real token amounts (e.g., 1000 tokens), the error can result in users receiving over 30 times more tokens than they should, or conversely, receiving a tiny fraction of what they're owed.

4. **Systemic Risk**: Since this library is used throughout the protocol, the error propagates to multiple components, creating systemic risk.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It directly affects token calculations and value transfers
- The error percentage is extremely high (up to 99.96%)
- It affects core protocol functionality
- It could lead to significant financial losses

## Proof of Concept
Add the following test to the FixedAdjustor test file located at `test/integrations/adjustor/FixedAdjustor.t.sol`:

```solidity
/**
 * @dev Test to demonstrate the precision loss vulnerability in FullMath library
 *  Incorrect use of caret operator in FullMath library
 * 
 * The vulnerability is in the FullMath library (lines 92 and 177) where the caret operator (^) is used incorrectly.
 * In Solidity, ^ is a bitwise XOR operator, not an exponentiation operator as it appears to be intended.
 * This leads to significant calculation errors that affect the entire protocol.

## Recommended Mitigation
Replace the incorrect use of the caret operator with proper multiplication in the FullMath.sol library:

```solidity
// Line 92: Replace this
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;
// With this
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) * (3 * denominator);

// Line 177: Replace this
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;
// With this
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) * (3 * denominator);
```

This change will ensure that the calculations are performed correctly, using actual exponentiation rather than bitwise XOR.
