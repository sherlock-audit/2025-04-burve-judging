# `removeValueSingle(...)` will always produce a zero `realTax` leading to issues

### Summary

When users want to remove value from a single `vertex` in a `closure` with `removeValueSingle`, the `Burve` protocol charges a tax to prevent users from using add value and remove value as a swapping mechanism. However, there seems to be an issue with how this tax is being calculated. After calculating the `nominalTax`, the `realTax` is set to zero, as it uses the uninitialized `removedBalance` instead of the `realRemoved` value.

### Root Cause

In `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle(...)`, the `realTax` being calculated will always be `0`, as it uses `removedBalance`, which [at the time it is being used will be zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L235-L239).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Create a closure with a `baseFee`.
2. Users add value to the closure.
3. Users start using `removeValueSingle` to get tokens back.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

1. The protocol will suffer losses, as part of the `realTax` is taken as protocol earnings.
2. Liquidity providers will lose out on `BGT` yield as well as on fee earnings.
3. Users will receive more than they should, as no tax will be deducted from the final `removedBalance` amount.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use `realRemoved` instead of `removedBalance` when calculating the `realTax`.
