# Missing Slippage and Deadline Protection in `SwapFacet` and `ValueFacet`

 # Summary

When users deposit funds, those assets are allocated to underlying ERC4626 markets. When withdrawing or redeeming, assets are pulled from the underlying markets. When swapping tokens, assets are pulled from one ERC4626 market and pushed to another.

However, the functions `addValue` and `removeValue` in the `ValueFacet` do not have both **slippage** and **deadline protection**, and none of the functions in the `SwapFacet` and `ValueFacet` have **deadline protection**.

The absence of deadline protection means users cannot cancel their actions once initiated. This exposes the system to potential manipulation by malicious miners, especially in the case of `addValue` and `removeValue`, which could be exploited for arbitrage or other malicious activities.


### Root Cause
[SwapFacet.sol#L52-L146](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L52-L146)
[ValueFacet.sol#L58-L277](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L58-L277)
In the `SwapFacet` and `ValueFacet`, the following functions do not have **deadline protection**:

### `SwapFacet`

- `swap()`
```solidity
function swap(
   address recipient,
   address inToken,
   address outToken,
   int256 amountSpecified,
   uint256 amountLimit,
   uint16 _cid
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount)
```

### `ValueFacet`

- `addValueSingle`
```solidity
function addValueSingle(
        address recipient,
        uint16 _closureId,
        uint128 value,
        uint128 bgtValue,
        address token,
        uint128 maxRequired
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 requiredBalance)
```

- `addSingleForValue`
```solidity
function addSingleForValue(
        address recipient,
        uint16 _closureId,
        address token,
        uint128 amount,
        uint256 bgtPercentX256,
        uint128 minValue
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 valueReceived)
```

- `removeValueSingle`
```solidity
function removeValueSingle(
        address recipient,
        uint16 _closureId,
        uint128 value,
        uint128 bgtValue,
        address token,
        uint128 minReceive
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 removedBalance)
```

- `removeSingleForValue`
```solidity
function removeSingleForValue(
        address recipient,
        uint16 _closureId,
        address token,
        uint128 amount,
        uint256 bgtPercentX256,
        uint128 maxValue
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 valueGiven)
```

Additionally, the functions `addValue` and `removeValue` in the `ValueFacet` do **not** have **slippage** or **deadline protection**.

- `addValue`
```solidity
function addValue(
   address recipient,
   uint16 _closureId,
   uint128 value,
   uint128 bgtValue
)
   external
   nonReentrant
   returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory requiredBalances)
```

- `removeValue`
```solidity
function removeValue(
   address recipient,
   uint16 _closureId,
   uint128 value,
   uint128 bgtValue
)
   external
   nonReentrant
   returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory receivedBalances)
```

### Impact

The lack of **deadline protection** means users cannot cancel their transactions once initiated. This opens the system to potential manipulation by malicious actors, particularly miners, who could exploit this to perform **arbitrage**, **front-running**, or other malicious actions.

For `addValue` and `removeValue`, the absence of **slippage protection** further exacerbates the risk, as the actual outcome of the transaction may differ significantly from the expected value, leading to potential loss of funds or unintended behavior.
