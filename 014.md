# Bypassed Slippage Protection in Exact Output Swaps Leads to User Fund Loss

### Summary

The `SwapFacet` contract contains a critical vulnerability in its slippage protection mechanism for exact output swaps. When users set `amountLimit = 0` (either deliberately or through UI/integration errors), all slippage protection is completely bypassed, allowing transactions to execute regardless of price movement. This asymmetric implementation differs from exact input swaps, which always enforce slippage controls, creating inconsistent behavior that can lead to substantial unexpected losses for users.


### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in `src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol:115` where the [slippage check is conditionally implemented](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L115):

```solidity
if (amountLimit != 0) {
    require(
        inAmount <= amountLimit,
        SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, inAmount, false)
    );
}
```

This conditional execution allows the slippage check to be completely bypassed when `amountLimit` is zero, unlike exact input swaps which unconditionally enforce slippage protection with:

```solidity
require(
    outAmount >= amountLimit,
    SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, outAmount, true)
);
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User executes an exact output swap by setting `amountSpecified` to a negative value
2. User (or an integrated frontend) sets `amountLimit = 0`, possibly:
   - Misinterpreting zero as "no limit" rather than "no protection"
   - Through a default value in a frontend integration
   - Due to a developer assumption that all slippage checks follow same pattern

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price movement occurs between transaction submission and execution, resulting in a higher required `inAmount` than expected
2. The price difference is significant enough to cause material loss to the user
3. Network congestion or high gas fees may prevent users from canceling transactions once submitted


### Attack Path


1. User intends to swap for exactly 100 WETH (`outToken`) using USDC (`inToken`)
2. Current market rate indicates cost of approximately 300,000 USDC
3. User calls `swap(recipient, usdcAddress, wethAddress, -100e18, 0, closureId)`
4. Between submission and execution, price of WETH increases relative to USDC
5. When executed, `c.swapOutExact(inVid, outVid, nominalOut)` calculates a new required `inAmount` of 350,000 USDC
6. Code execution reaches `if (amountLimit != 0)` condition
7. Since `amountLimit` is 0, the condition fails and slippage check is completely bypassed
8. Transaction executes, transferring 350,000 USDC from user (50,000 more than expected) for 100 WETH


### Impact

- **Users**: May suffer unlimited slippage losses based on market volatility
- **Severity**: Critical, as it directly results in financial loss with no protection
- **Frequency**: High risk during volatile market conditions or congested networks
- **Measurable Loss**: Difference between expected swap rate and executed rate (potentially unlimited)
- **Associated Risks**: 
  - Creates arbitrage opportunities for MEV bots to exploit
  - Undermines user trust in the protocol
  - Asymmetric behavior creates confusion and increases support burden


### PoC

1. Setup: Alice wants to swap for exactly 100 WETH (outToken) using USDC (inToken). The current market rate implies this should cost roughly 300,000 USDC.
2. Transaction: Alice calls swap(recipient, usdcAddress, wethAddress, -100e18, 0, closureId). Note the amountLimit is mistakenly set to 0.
3. Market Shift: Between transaction submission and execution, the price of WETH spikes. The swapOutExact calculation determines that receiving 100 WETH now requires 350,000 USDC (inAmount = 350000e6).
4. Execution:
  - The code reaches the check if (amountLimit != 0). Since amountLimit is 0, the condition (0 != 0) is false.
  - The require(inAmount <= amountLimit, ...) statement inside the if block is skipped.
  - The transaction proceeds. Alice's account is debited 350,000 USDC, and she receives 100 WETH.
 5. Outcome: Alice paid 50,000 USDC more than expected due to slippage, and the transaction did not revert because the slippage check was bypassed by setting amountLimit = 0.
