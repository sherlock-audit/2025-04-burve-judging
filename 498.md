# Wrong approval will ensure the deposit and `mint` to uniswapV3 pool will revert

### Summary

In the `Burve` contract, approvals are made per transaction for the specific transaction amounts and the contract destinations - but the contract incorrectly approves itself (address(this)) instead of approving the `pool` when attempting to mint. 

This incorrect approval will ensure that the `pool` is not approved to spend the required `token0` and `token1` when calling the `mint` function of `pool`.

### Root Cause

In `compoundV3Ranges` the `Burve` contract attempts to approve the `pool` for `token0` and `token1` amounts so that it can call the `mint` function of `pool` and deposit those tokens and mint tokens from the pool - but the contract incorrectly approves itself `address(this)` instead of approving the `pool` 

```solidity
 // approve mints
->        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(this), totalMint0);
 ->       SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(this), totalMint1);

        // mint to each range
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
            TickRange memory range = memRanges[i];

            if (range.isIsland()) {
                continue;
            }

            uint128 compoundLiq = compoundLiqs[i];
            if (compoundLiq == 0) {
                continue;
            }

            pool.mint(
                address(this),
                range.lower,
                range.upper,
                compoundLiq,
                abi.encode(address(this))
            );
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

THis is not an attack, rather an incorrect logic which approves itself `Burve` contract instead of the `pool`

### Impact

The `pool` will not be approved for the `token0` and `token1` amounts, which will result in the minting process to fail. When `BUrve` attempts to call the `mint` function of the `pool` - the `pool` will attempt to pull `token0` and `token1` amounts, so that it can mint the resulting tokens to the `Burve` contract, but will be unable to do so because of the lack of approval.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Approve the `pool` contract address instead of approving itself.
