# Attacker will exploit reentrancy in mint() to manipulate shares and drain liquidity

### Summary

The missing reentrancy protection in Burve.sol. will allow an attacker to repeatedly call mint() via fallback and manipulate LP share distribution, leading to a drain of assets from the pool.


### Root Cause

In [`Burve.sol:222`](link-to-line), there is no reentrancy guard on `mint()`. The function makes several external calls (e.g., `stationProxy.depositLP`, `pool.mint`, and `token.transferFrom`) before updating critical state (`islandSharesPerOwner`, `totalNominalLiq`).


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker must have a smart contract that can receive ETH and call `mint()` recursively.
2. `stationProxy` and `island` must not restrict external calls or enforce reentrancy guards.
3. `msg.sender` has enough approved tokens to pass the `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom` step.


### External Pre-conditions

1. No slippage or delay in the external `pool.mint()` and `collect()` calls.
2. `stationProxy.depositLP()` must not revert when called twice in a nested call.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker contract calls `mint()` with minimal liquidity.
2. During `stationProxy.depositLP()`, fallback is triggered.
3. Fallback calls `mint()` again before the first call finishes.
4. State variables like `totalNominalLiq` and `islandSharesPerOwner` are manipulated across both calls.
5. The attacker gains more LP tokens than they are entitled to.


### Impact

The protocol suffers incorrect LP share distribution, potentially losing up to 100% of pooled assets. Attacker mints excess shares and drains tokens by burning them later or exploiting exit logic.


### PoC

contract Exploit {
    Burve burve;

    constructor(address _burve) {
        burve = Burve(_burve);
    }

    fallback() external {
        // Recursive reentrancy trigger
        if (address(burve).balance > 0) {
            burve.mint(address(this), 1000, tickLower, tickUpper);
        }
    }

    function pwn() external {
        burve.mint(address(this), 1000, tickLower, tickUpper);
    }
}


### Mitigation

- Add `nonReentrant` modifier to `mint()` using OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.
- Reorder logic in `mint()` to follow checks-effects-interactions.
- Consider reentrancy-safe patterns when using external contracts like `stationProxy` or `pool`.
