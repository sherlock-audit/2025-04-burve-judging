# Ownership transfer cannot be completed due to missing acceptOwnership function selector

### Summary

The missing [`acceptOwnership`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/lib/Commons/src/Util/Admin.sol#L119) function selector in the Diamond contract will cause ownership transfers to be permanently stuck for the protocol as pending owners cannot complete the two-step ownership transfer process

### Root Cause

In [`Diamond.sol:68-71`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L68-L71) the adminSelectors array only includes transferOwnership, owner, and adminRights selectors, but is missing the acceptOwnership selector, which prevents the completion of the two-step ownership transfer process

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The SimplexDiamond contract implements a two-step ownership transfer process
2. The BaseAdminFacet contract has both transferOwnership and acceptOwnership functions
3. Only the transferOwnership function selector is registered in the Diamond contract
4. The acceptOwnership function selector is not registered, making it inaccessible

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required for this vulnerability

### Attack Path

1. The current owner calls transferOwnership(newOwner) to initiate ownership transfer
2. The contract sets the pendingOwner to newOwner
3. The newOwner attempts to call acceptOwnership() to complete the transfer
4. The call reverts with FunctionNotFound(0x79ba5097) because the acceptOwnership selector is not registered
5. The ownership transfer remains in a pending state indefinitely
6. The original owner retains control of the contract, even though they intended to transfer ownership
7. If the original owner loses access to their private key, the contract becomes permanently stuck with the original owner

### Impact

1. Permanent centralization risk if the original owner needs to transfer control
2. If the original owner loses access to their private key, the contract becomes permanently stuck
3. Inability to transition to a more decentralized governance model in the future
4. False sense of security from a two-step ownership transfer process that cannot be completed
5. This issue becomes particularly problematic since the README explicitly states that owners are "trusted individuals (that will be decentralized over time)", but the current implementation would prevent any ownership transfer from being completed, effectively blocking the planned decentralization process

        assertFalse(success, "acceptOwnership should not be callable - function selector not registered");
        
        // Verify owner is still the original owner (ownership transfer cannot be completed)
        (success, result) = address(diamond).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("owner()"));
        assertTrue(success, "Failed to call owner function");
        address finalOwner = abi.decode(result, (address));
        assertEq(finalOwner, owner, "Owner should remain unchanged since acceptOwnership is not available");
        
        // Demonstrate the issue: ownership is stuck in a pending state
        // The original owner can still perform owner actions
        vm.prank(owner);
        (success, ) = address(diamond).call(abi.encodeWithSignature("transferOwnership(address)", address(0x5)));
        assertTrue(success, "Original owner should still have ownership privileges");
        
        // But the pending owner cannot accept ownership due to missing function selector
        console.log("VULNERABILITY: acceptOwnership() function selector is not registered in the Diamond contract");
        console.log("This means ownership transfers can be initiated but never completed");
        console.log("The pending owner cannot accept ownership, leaving the contract in a potentially vulnerable state");
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add the acceptOwnership function selector to the adminSelectors array in the Diamond.sol constructor:

```solidity
bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](4); // Change from 3 to 4
adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;
adminSelectors[3] = BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership.selector; // Add this line
```

This will register the acceptOwnership function selector in the Diamond contract, allowing the two-step ownership transfer process to be completed.
