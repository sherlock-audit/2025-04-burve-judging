# Minter may receive zero shares and lose contributed funds when minting small amounts due to rounding

### Summary

After the initial "dead shares" mint, the pool operates with `Burve::totalShares > 0` and `Burve::totalNominalLiq > 0`. When a user subsequently calls the `Burve::mint` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226), the number of shares they receive is calculated as `shares = FullMath.mulDiv(mintNominalLiq, totalShares, totalNominalLiq)`. Due to integer division rounding down in `FullMath.mulDiv`, if the `mintNominalLiq` provided by the user is less than the current nominal liquidity represented by one share (`totalNominalLiq / totalShares`), the calculated `shares` amount will be zero. However, the function still proceeds to transfer the user's underlying tokens (`token0` and `token1`) to add liquidity to the V3 positions or the Island. The `totalNominalLiq` of the pool increases, but `totalShares` does not. The recipient receives zero LP shares, while the minter (`msg.sender`) loses the value of the tokens they provided.


### Root Cause

The calculation `shares = FullMath.mulDiv(mintNominalLiq, totalShares, totalNominalLiq)` uses integer division which truncates the result. If `(mintNominalLiq * totalShares)` is less than `totalNominalLiq`, the result `shares` becomes 0. This occurs when the value of the minted nominal liquidity is less than the value represented by a single existing share.

### Internal Pre-conditions

*   The `mint` function is called after the initial dead shares mint has completed.
*   `totalShares > 0` (specifically `totalShares >= MIN_DEAD_SHARES`).
*   `totalNominalLiq > 0`.


### External Pre-conditions

*   A user (`msg.sender`) calls the `mint` function providing liquidity.
*   The user provides a `mintNominalLiq` value such that `0 < mintNominalLiq < (totalNominalLiq / totalShares)`.
*   The user possesses and approves the necessary `token0` and `token1` amounts corresponding to `mintNominalLiq`.


### Attack Path

(This describes the sequence leading to the issue, the "attacker" could simply be an unaware user)
1.  Identify a Burve pool where the initial mint is complete (`totalShares > 0`).
2.  Calculate the threshold: `threshold = totalNominalLiq / totalShares`.
3.  Choose a small, non-zero `mintNominalLiq` value such that `mintNominalLiq < threshold`.
4.  Calculate the required `token0` and `token1` for this `mintNominalLiq`. Ensure sufficient balance and approve the Burve contract.
5.  Call the `mint` function with the chosen `mintNominalLiq` and a recipient address.
6.  The contract calculates `shares = 0` due to the `FullMath.mulDiv` rounding.
7.  The contract transfers the user's `token0` and `token1` to add liquidity to the underlying positions/Island.
8.  The contract increments `totalNominalLiq` by `mintNominalLiq`.
9.  The contract increments `totalShares` by 0.
10. The contract mints 0 LP shares to the recipient.
11. The user (`msg.sender`) has spent their tokens but the recipient received no LP shares.


### Impact

*   **Loss of Funds:** Users attempting to mint very small amounts of liquidity (relative to the pool size) will lose their deposited tokens without receiving any LP shares in return.
*   **Inflation of Share Value:** The deposited liquidity increases `totalNominalLiq` without increasing `totalShares`, effectively donating value to existing LPs and slightly inflating the value backing each existing share.
