# Inconsistent Lock Checking in Burve Protocol


## Description
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L176
The Burve protocol has a inconsistency in how token locking is handled across different withdrawal functions. This inconsistency creates a situation where users are unnecessarily prevented from withdrawing their tokens in certain scenarios.

The key issue is that single-token withdrawal functions (`removeValueSingle` and `removeTokenForValue`) check if any token in the closure is locked using `isAnyLocked(self)`, while the multi-token withdrawal function (`removeValue`) does not have this check. This creates a contradictory situation where:

Users cannot withdraw a single token if any token in the closure is locked (even if the token they want to withdraw is not locked)
But users can withdraw all tokens at once using `removeValue`, even if some of those tokens are locked
This is further complicated by the fact that the lower-level `Vertex.withdraw` function has a `checkLock` parameter that is set to false in all withdrawal functions, which suggests an intention to allow withdrawals even from locked vertices. There's even an explicit comment in `removeValue` stating: "Users can remove value even if the token is locked. It actually helps derisk us."

Additionally, there is an issue with fee processing. If a user first adds a token through one of the single-token input functions (such as `addValueSingle` or `addSingleForValue`), paying a fee, and then wants to bypass the `isAnyLocked` checks by calling `removeValue`, the fee they paid when adding the token will not be added to `addEarnings`, as `removeValue` does not handle this fee processing. As a result, this fee gets stuck in the storage of that Vertex and is not properly distributed.

## Proof of Concept
The issue can be observed in the following code sections:

1. In `Closure.sol`, single-token withdrawal functions check if any token is locked:
```solidity
function removeValueSingle(
    Closure storage self,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue,
    VertexId vid
) internal returns (uint256 removedAmount, uint256 tax) {
    require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid)); // Prevents withdrawal if ANY token is locked
    // ...
}

function removeTokenForValue(
    Closure storage self,
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 bgtPercentX256,
    SearchParams memory searchParams
) internal returns (uint256 value, uint256 bgtValue, uint256 tax) {
    require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid)); // Prevents withdrawal if ANY token is locked
    // ...
}
```
2. However, the removeValue function in Closure.sol does not have this check:
```solidity
function removeValue(
    Closure storage self,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue
) internal returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory withdrawnBalances) {
    trimAllBalances(self);
    // No isAnyLocked check here
    // ...
}
```
3. In  `ValueFacet.sol`, there's an explicit comment indicating that locked tokens should be withdrawable:
```solidity
function removeValue(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue
)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory receivedBalances)
{
    // ...
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
        if (!cid.contains(i)) continue;
        address token = tokenReg.tokens[i];
        uint256 realSend = AdjustorLib.toReal(
            token,
            nominalReceives[i],
            false
        );
        receivedBalances[i] = realSend;
        // Users can remove value even if the token is locked. It actually helps derisk us.
        Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realSend, false);
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, realSend);
    }
}
```
4. The Vertex.withdraw function has a flexible lock check that is bypassed when checkLock = false:
```solidity
function withdraw(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount,
    bool checkLock
) internal {
    require(!(checkLock && self._isLocked), VertexLocked(self.vid)); // Only checks if checkLock = true
    // ...
}
```
5. In single-token withdrawal functions (removeValueSingle and removeSingleForValue), there is fee processing through `addEarnings`:
```solidity
function removeValueSingle(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue,
    address token,
    uint128 minReceive
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 removedBalance) {
    // ...
    uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
        removedBalance,
        nominalTax,
        removedNominal
    );
    c.addEarnings(vid, realTax); // Fee is added to earnings
    // ...
}
```
6. However, in the removeValue function, there is no fee processing through addEarnings:
```solidity
function removeValue(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue
)
    external
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory receivedBalances)
{
    // ...
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
        // ...
        Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realSend, false);
        // No addEarnings call for fee processing
        // ...
    }
}
```

This creates a contradictory situation where the protocol has a mechanism to allow withdrawals from locked vertices (by setting `checkLock = false`), and this mechanism is used in `removeValue`, but it is nullified by the higher-level checks in the single-token withdrawal functions. Additionally, fees paid when adding tokens through single-token input functions are not properly processed when withdrawing through removeValue.

## Recommendation
To make the locking behavior more consistent and aligned with the apparent intention (allowing withdrawals from locked vertices), the isAnyLocked check should be removed from single-token withdrawal functions.

1. Make the locking behavior consistent across all withdrawal functions by either: a) Removing the isAnyLocked check from single-token withdrawal functions to align with the apparent intention of allowing withdrawals from locked vertices. This approach would allow users to withdraw from unlocked vertices even if other vertices in the closure are locked, which aligns with the comment in removeValue and the use of checkLock = false. OR b) Adding the isAnyLocked check to removeValue to prevent withdrawals from any locked vertices
2. Add fee processing to the removeValue function, if the input was by adding a single token
