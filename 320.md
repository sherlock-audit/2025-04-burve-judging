# The Deposit-Withdrawal Asymmetry

## Description
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214
A critical asymmetry has been identified in the Burve protocol regarding token lock checks between deposit and withdrawal functions. The `removeSingleForValue` function (through the `c.removeTokenForValue` call) checks if any token in the closure is locked using the `isAnyLocked` function, while the `addSingleForValue` function (through the `c.addTokenForValue` call) only checks if the specific token being interacted with is locked.

This asymmetry creates an unfair situation where users can deposit funds into unlocked tokens within a closure but cannot withdraw them if any other token in the same closure is locked. This can lead to unintentional fund locking and a negative user experience.

## Proof of Concept

1. In the `removeTokenForValue` function in `Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol` (line 347), there is a check:
```solidity
require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
```
2. The `isAnyLocked` function checks if any token in the closure is locked:
```solidity
function isAnyLocked(Closure storage self) internal returns (bool isLocked) {
    for (
        VertexId vIter = VertexLib.minId();
        !vIter.isStop();
        vIter = vIter.inc()
    ) {
        if (self.cid.contains(vIter)) {
            if (Store.vertex(vIter).isLocked()) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
3. Meanwhile, the addTokenForValue function does not contain such a check, and the deposit function in Vertex.sol only checks if the specific token is locked:
```solidity
function deposit(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    require(!self._isLocked, VertexLocked(self.vid));
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.deposit(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```
4. Problem scenario:

- A closure contains tokens A and B
- Token A is locked, token B is not locked
- A user can add token B through addSingleForValue, which calls c.addTokenForValue
- But the user cannot withdraw token B through `removeSingleForValue`, which calls c.removeTokenForValue, because token A is locked
- The user's funds become trapped in the protocol with no way to withdraw them

5. This creates a risk for users as they can deposit funds without knowing they won't be able to withdraw them due to another token being locked in the same closure.

## Recommendation

To address this asymmetry, one of the following solutions is recommended:

1. Remove the `isAnyLocked` check from the `removeTokenForValue` function and keep only the specific token lock check, similar to the deposit function:
```solidity
function removeTokenForValue(
    Closure storage self,
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 bgtPercentX256,
    SearchParams memory searchParams
) internal returns (uint256 value, uint256 bgtValue, uint256 tax) {
    require(self.cid.contains(vid), IrrelevantVertex(self.cid, vid));
    // Removed the !isAnyLocked(self) check
    trimAllBalances(self);
 ...
}
```
2. Alternatively, add the isAnyLocked check to the addTokenForValue function for symmetry:
```solidity
function addTokenForValue(
    Closure storage self,
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 bgtPercentX256,
    SearchParams memory searchParams
) internal returns (uint256 value, uint256 bgtValue, uint256 tax) {
    require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotAddWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
    require(self.cid.contains(vid), IrrelevantVertex(self.cid, vid));
    ...
}
```
The first option is preferable as it improves the user experience by allowing users to withdraw their funds from unlocked tokens, even if other tokens in the closure are locked. This also aligns with the principle of least surprise for users who expect that if they can deposit a token, they should also be able to withdraw it.
