# Invariant Break When Adjusting e Without Target Recalculation

# Invariant Break When Adjusting e Without Target Recalculation

### Summary

The Burve protocol allows the admin to adjust the efficiency factor `e` using `SimplexFacet::setEX128`. This parameter directly affects the internal value calculations of the system. While the protocol assumes that small changes to `e` are safe, in reality, any adjustment can shift the computed value of the closure if token balances \( x \) are not exactly aligned with the target \( t \). Since the system does not automatically recalculate or validate the target after updating `e`, even a minor change can break critical system invariants. This puts the closure at risk of becoming permanently unusable, as future operations (such as adding or removing liquidity) may fail or revert, effectively freezing the closure and locking funds. 


### Root Cause

According to the Burve official documentation:

> Therefore the liquidity is effectively concentrated around the price of one, and we can adjust the level of concentration simply by updating e.

The admin can call `SimplexFacet::setEX128` to adjust the efficiency factor `e`:

```solidity
function setEX128(address token, uint256 eX128) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();
    uint8 idx = TokenRegLib.getIdx(token);
    emit EfficiencyFactorChanged(
        msg.sender,
        token,
        SimplexLib.getEX128(idx),
        eX128
    );
    SimplexLib.setEX128(idx, eX128); 
}
```

Every time `e` is adjusted, the value function is:

$$
v(x) = e \cdot t + 2t - \frac{(e \cdot t + t)^2}{x + e \cdot t}
$$

Notably, only when \( x = t \), the value becomes independent of \( e \) and simplifies to \( t \):

```solidity
v = e * t + 2 * t - ((e * t + t)^2 / (t + e * t)) = e * t + 2 * t - (e * t + t) = t
```

However, because Burve supports swaps, the \( x \) values of tokens are usually deviated from \( t \). When \( $x \neq t $\), the value \( v \) directly depends on the size of \( e \), meaning any adjustment to \( e \) will change the calculated value.

The detailed form is:

$$
V(x) = e t + 2t - \frac{(e t + t)^2}{x + e t}
= \frac{(e t + 2t)(x + e t) - (e t + t)^2}{x + e t}
= \frac{(x + e t) x + 2t x - t^2 - x^2}{x + e t}
= x + \frac{2t x - t^2 - x^2}{x + e t}
$$

Specifically, when \( x \) and \( t \) remain constant, the larger the \( e \), the smaller the \( v \), and vice versa.

Assume a closure contains three tokens A, B, and C.

Initially, it satisfies:

```solidity
v(A) + v(B) + v(C) = 3 * target
```

If the `e` of token A changes, even with the system’s built-in buffer of \( $deMinimus \times 3 $\), any small change in \( e \) can break the following invariant:

> The "value" of the closure (according to the formulas) can never be more than deMinimus × (number of tokens in the closure) from the target value of the pool times number of tokens in the closure.

In the worst-case scenario, the system might never find a valid new target within the allowed error range, rendering the closure completely unusable.


### Attack Path

1.The admin adjusts the \( e \) value for a token.

2.Because \( $x \neq t $\), this changes the computed value \( v \).

3.The summed closure value \( $v(A) + v(B) + v(C)$ \) now deviates beyond the allowed invariant, even though the system has some buffer.

4.Without recalculating and validating the target, later operations (such as adding or removing liquidity) may revert, leaving the closure frozen.

### Impact

Without verifying the effect of updating `e`, the system risks breaking core invariants. This can cause subsequent operations to fail, leading to closures that cannot add or remove liquidity, effectively freezing the closure and locking user funds.


### Mitigation

1.Immediately attempt to update the target after adjusting `e`, and revert if no valid target is found.

To do this, the system must call:

```solidity
function t(  
    SearchParams memory searchParams,  
    uint256[] memory esX128,
    uint256[] memory xs,
    uint256 tX128
)
```

If no target is found, the system should revert. Otherwise, later functions interacting with the closure may revert, making the closure unusable. The current system lacks a direct mechanism to update the target after changing `e`.


2.Manually adjust ( x ) to match ( t ), then update `e`.

a. (Optional) Freeze the relevant token using `LockFacet.lock(token)` to prevent user operations or front-running during migration.

b. Use `Vertex.withdraw/deposit` or admin scripts to adjust `balances[idx]` back to \( t \).

c. Have the owner call `SimplexFacet.setEX128(token, newE)` to update \( e \).

d. Unlock the token using `LockFacet.unlock(token)`.

This ensures that the system remains consistent and avoids breaking critical invariants when efficiency adjustments are applied.
