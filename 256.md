# The vProxy.balance function may overflow, which can cause the protocol function to not work properly.

### Summary

在E4626.balance()函数中，存在这样一段注释：
```solidity
        // For the pegged assets we're interested in,
        // it would be insane to have more than 2^128 of any token so this is unlikely.
        // And if it is hit, users will withdraw until it goes below because their LP is forcibly trading
        // below NAV.
        amount = min128(fullAmount);
```

If the balance of a given vault reaches 2^128, the expectation here is that the depth of liquidity will be reduced by taking liquidity through user funds. But in practice, it won't work as expected, and the spillover destroys the token economics of the protocol as expected.

If there is a backup vault and active reaches 2^128, in time the backup vault only has 1 wei asset, there will be an overflow, and add/remove liquidity, swap, and claim will not work. 
This is because in the VaultProxy.balance function, the balance of the two vaults is simply summed using uint128.
```solidity
    function balance(
        VaultProxy memory self,
        ClosureId cid,
        bool roundUp
    ) internal view returns (uint128 amount) {
        return
            self.active.balance(cid, roundUp) +
            self.backup.balance(cid, roundUp);
    }
```
And the VaultProxy.balance function is called by the vertex.trimBalance function. Adding/removing mobility, swap, and claiming rewards all settle rewards first, and all rely on a successful call to the vertex.trimBalance function.

### Root Cause

In the [VaultProxy.balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L213-L221) function, add the balances of the two vaults with uint128.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The funds in a certain vault reached 2^128.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Once both the Active and Backup vaults exist and a vault has reached 2^128-1.
2. All functions of the protocol will be unavailable due to overflow.

### Impact

All functions of the protocol may not be available, including the withdrawal of liquidity, etc.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to use uint256 in the VaultProxy.balance function for calculation.
