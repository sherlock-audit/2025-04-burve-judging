# Closure.addEarnings() will bypass Vertex locking mechanism, potentially corrupting vault state

### Summary

The missing lock check in `Closure.addEarnings()` will cause state inconsistency for a `Vertex`, as `Closure` bypasses the `Vertex._isLocked` condition enforced in `Vertex.deposit()`, allowing silent and unauthorized state mutations.

### Root Cause

In `Closure.sol:addEarnings()`, there is a call to `ReserveLib.deposit()` which ultimately leads to deposit on a vertex without verifying `Vertex._isLocked`.

Closure.sol
```solidity
function addEarnings(
    Closure storage self,
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 earnings
) internal {
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    ...
    // We total the shares earned and split after to reduce our vault deposits, and
    // we potentially lose one less dust.
    uint256 reserveShares = ReserveLib.deposit(vid, unspent + userAmount); // Direct deposit
    ...
}
```

But, in `Vertex.sol:deposit`, a lock check `require(!self._isLocked)` is enforced, which is not respected upstream in the closure flow.

Vertex.sol
```solidity
function deposit(
    Vertex storage self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    require(!self._isLocked, VertexLocked(self.vid)); // Lock check
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.deposit(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```

The design assumes all depositors check for this lock, but `addEarnings()` in `Closure.sol` doesn't, leading to silent, inconsistent state updates when deposits are performed from a locked vertex.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Closure operation triggers `addEarnings()` with a valid vid
2. The underlying Vertex is in a locked state `(_isLocked == true)`
3. The call to `ReserveLib.deposit()` executes without checking the lock status

### Impact

The protocol suffers a vault state inconsistency, where a Vertex assumed to be locked from state changes is mutated via deposits.
This may lead to unpredictable accounting bugs, incorrect share allocations, or security assumptions being invalidated during time-sensitive operations.

### PoC


Closure.sol
```solidity
function addEarnings(
    Closure storage self,
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 earnings
) internal {
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    ...
    // We total the shares earned and split after to reduce our vault deposits, and
    // we potentially lose one less dust.
    uint256 reserveShares = ReserveLib.deposit(vid, unspent + userAmount); // Direct deposit without checking locking status
    ...
}
```
