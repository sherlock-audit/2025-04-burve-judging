# Incorrect Tax Calculation in RemoveValueSingle in ValueFacet.sol

### Summary

**Using an uninitialized `removedBalance` variable in the `realTax` calculation** will cause **a loss of protocol fees** for **the protocol** as **users** will **withdraw liquidity without paying the intended tax**.

### Root Cause

**In `[ValueFacet.sol:214-244](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214-244)`, the `realTax` calculation uses an uninitialized `removedBalance` variable**, which defaults to zero, causing `realTax` to be zero regardless of the `nominalTax` value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Owner needs to call `setClosureFees` to set** the closure's fee to be **at least 1 (non-zero)** to ensure `nominalTax` is non-zero.
2. **User needs to call `addValueSingle` or `addValue` to set** their value balance in the closure to be **at least the amount they intend to withdraw** (e.g., `1e18`).

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **User calls `addValueSingle`** to deposit liquidity into a closure (e.g., closure `0x9` with tokens 1 and 4) with a non-zero value (e.g., `1e19`).
2. **User calls `removeValueSingle`** to withdraw a portion of their value (e.g., `1e18`) using a valid token (e.g., `tokens[0]`).
3. **The contract calculates `realTax` using `FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal)`**, where `removedBalance` is uninitialized (zero), resulting in `realTax = 0`.
4. **The contract calls `c.addEarnings(vid, realTax)`** with `realTax = 0`, adding no earnings to the protocol.
5. **The user receives the full `realRemoved` amount** as `removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax = realRemoved - 0`, bypassing the intended tax.

### Impact

**The protocol suffers an approximate loss of the intended tax amount (proportional to the withdrawal amount and fee rate)**. The user gains the tax amount they should have paid, as they receive the full withdrawal without deduction.

### PoC

The following test case from `ValueFacet.t.sol` confirms the issue by demonstrating that no earnings (tax) are added during `removeValueSingle` despite a non-zero fee:
```solidity
    function testRemoveValueSingleZeroTax() public {
        // Test to confirm the bug in removeValueSingle where tax is calculated as zero due to uninitialized removedBalance.
        uint256 oneX128 = 1 << 128;
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        // Set a non-zero fee to ensure nominalTax is non-zero
        simplexFacet.setClosureFees(0x9, uint128(oneX128 / 10000), 0); // One basis point (0.01%)
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Add liquidity as Alice to closure 0x9 (tokens 1,4) using token 0
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        uint128 valueToAdd = 1e19;
        uint128 bgtValue = 5e18;
        uint256 requiredBalance = valueFacet.addValueSingle(
            alice,
            0x9,
            valueToAdd,
            bgtValue,
            tokens[0],
            0
        );
        (
            uint256 value,
            uint256 bgtValueQueried,
            uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory earningsBefore,

        ) = valueFacet.queryValue(alice, 0x9);
        assertEq(value, valueToAdd, "Value added incorrect");
        assertEq(bgtValueQueried, bgtValue, "BGT value added incorrect");

        // Remove a portion of the value using token 0
        uint128 valueToRemove = 1e18;
        uint128 bgtValueToRemove = 1e17;
        uint256[4] memory initBalances = getBalances(alice);
        uint256 received = valueFacet.removeValueSingle(
            alice,
            0x9,
            valueToRemove,
            bgtValueToRemove,
            tokens[0],
            0
        );
        uint256[4] memory finalBalances = getBalances(alice);
        int256[4] memory diffs = diffBalances(finalBalances, initBalances);

        // Check that Alice received tokens (token 0)
        assertEq(uint256(diffs[0]), received, "Received tokens incorrect");
        assertGt(received, 0, "No tokens received");

        // Check earnings after removal to confirm no tax was added
        (, , uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory earningsAfter, ) = valueFacet
            .queryValue(alice, 0x9);
        assertEq(
            earningsAfter[0],
            earningsBefore[0],
            "Earnings for token 0 increased unexpectedly"
        );
        // Since closure 0x9 includes tokens 1 and 4 (indices 0 and 3), check relevant tokens
        assertEq(
            earningsAfter[3],
            earningsBefore[3],
            "Earnings for token 3 increased unexpectedly"
        );

        // Note: We cannot directly access realTax or nominalTax in the test, but we infer zero tax
        // because earnings did not increase and the full amount was received (checked via symmetry tests).
        // The test confirms the bug by showing no earnings are added despite a non-zero fee.

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```
This test passes, confirming that earnings do not increase after `removeValueSingle`, indicating `realTax = 0` due to the uninitialized `removedBalance.`

### Mitigation

Modify the `removeValueSingle` function in `ValueFacet.sol` to use `realRemoved`instead of `removedBalance` in the `realTax` calculation
