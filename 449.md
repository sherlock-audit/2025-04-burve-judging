# Balance inconsistency in trimBalance due to vault deposit fees


## Summary
The trimBalance function in Vertex.sol fails to account for deposit fees charged by ERC4626 vaults, leading to a state where the recorded token balance exceeds the actual vault assets.

## Root Cause
In Vertex.sol:60-83, the balance check assumes 1:1 conversion between tokens and vault shares:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L60

The issue occurs because:

```solidity
function trimBalance(Vertex storage self, ClosureId cid, uint256 targetReal, uint256 value, uint256 bgtValue)
    internal
    returns (uint256 reserveSharesEarned, uint256 bgtResidual)
{
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    uint256 realBalance = vProxy.balance(cid, false);
    if (targetReal > realBalance) {
        emit InsufficientBalance(self.vid, cid, targetReal, realBalance);
        return (0, 0);
    }
    // ...remaining code...
}
```
- Closure balance is updated with full token amount
- Tokens are then deposited into vault
- Vault takes deposit fee
- Actual vault assets become less than recorded balance

## Pre-conditions

Internal Pre-conditions
ERC4626 vault must charge deposit fees

External Pre-conditions
Vault implementation must include non-zero deposit fees

## Attack Path
User deposits 100 tokens
Closure records 100 token balance
Tokens deposited to vault with 5% fee:
- 95 tokens converted to shares
- 5 tokens taken as fee

trimBalance called:
- targetReal = 100
- realBalance = 95
Triggers InsufficientBalance event
System enters inconsistent state

## Impact
The protocol experiences accounting mismatches:

Balance checks fail unnecessarily
Incorrect insufficient balance events
Potential blocking of legitimate withdrawals
System may require manual intervention

## Mitigation
Account for vault fees in token balance calculation
