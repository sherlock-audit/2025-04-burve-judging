# Locked BGT Funds Due to Improper Backup Handling in BGTExchanger

# Locked BGT Funds Due to Improper Backup Handling in BGTExchanger

### Summary

The BGTExchanger contract incorrectly aggregates a user’s owed BGT balance from both the current and backup exchangers but performs withdrawals only from the current exchanger’s local token balance. This leads to a situation where users see a combined balance they can’t fully access, because the system fails to transfer owed tokens from the backup contract. As a result, any BGT remaining in a backup exchanger becomes permanently locked and unclaimable, despite being reported in the user’s `getOwed()` balance.


### Root Cause

Users can call `BGTExchanger::getOwed` to calculate the amount of BGT they are entitled to within the exchange.

```solidity
function getOwed(address caller) public view returns (uint256 _owed) {
    _owed = owed[caller];
    if (address(backupEx) != address(0)) {
        _owed += backupEx.getOwed(caller);
    }
    _owed -= withdrawn[caller];
}
```

> * New BGTExchanger configurations use the previous one as a backup.

It’s important to note that when the exchange is updated, the previous contract is set as a backup. When users call `getOwed`, their balance in the backup exchanger is also added to their total owed BGT.

However, when the user calls `withdraw`, as long as the user’s total owed BGT (from current + backup) is greater than or equal to the requested `bgtAmount`, the withdrawal proceeds.

```solidity
function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 bgtAmount) external {
    uint256 _owed = getOwed(msg.sender);
    if (bgtAmount == 0) return;
    if (_owed < bgtAmount) revert InsufficientOwed();  
    withdrawn[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;  // @audit does not update recipient owed mapping
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, recipient, bgtAmount);
}
```

The issue is that when the actual transfer happens, the contract does **not** attempt to transfer from the backup; it only uses the balance in the current exchanger. If the current exchanger’s balance is less than `bgtAmount`, the transfer fails, and the user’s BGT in the backup exchanger is permanently locked and inaccessible.


### Attack Path

When a user has leftover BGT in a backup (20) and has 80 in the current exchanger, `getOwed` reports 100.
However, when the user tries to `withdraw` 100, the contract only tries to transfer from the current exchanger’s BGT balance.
If the current exchanger only holds 80 BGT, `TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, recipient, bgtAmount)` fails, and the backup-held balance can never be claimed or moved, effectively locking the backup’s funds.

Any user who has legacy BGT owed in a backup exchanger but attempts to withdraw the **combined** balance (current + backup) will encounter a failed transfer if the current exchanger contract does not hold enough BGT to cover the request. The backup contract’s BGT balance is never touched nor transferred, leaving those funds permanently inaccessible.

### Impact

This results in a situation where users’ BGT held in backup exchangers are effectively locked and unrecoverable if they try to withdraw the full reported owed balance. Even though the system tracks the combined owed amount, the contract is incapable of delivering tokens from backups, causing withdrawal failures and permanent loss of access to those funds.


### Mitigation

Update the `withdraw` logic to explicitly check the current exchanger’s balance. If it is insufficient, the contract should attempt to withdraw the remainder from the backup exchanger, either by calling a `withdraw` function on the backup or by transferring BGT from the backup to the current exchanger first. Additionally, carefully update the `withdrawn` mappings across both exchangers to ensure consistency and avoid double counting.
