# Unprotected arithmetic in FullMath may revert valid operations, causing unexpected DoS

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L119

 The use of checked arithmetic (default in Solidity ≥0.8.0) in FullMath.sol will cause valid large multiplications and rounding operations to revert unexpectedly, introducing a denial-of-service risk to any protocol relying on these functions for price math or liquidity calculations.

### Root Cause

 In FullMath.sol, the mulDiv() and mulDivRoundingUp() functions contain arithmetic operations like a * b, prod1 * twos, and result++ which were intended to wrap as in Solidity <0.8.0. Without using unchecked { ... }, these operations revert when they overflow, breaking the assumption of Uniswap's 512-bit math.

Example lines:

    prod0 |= prod1 * twos; (in mulDiv)

    result++; (in mulDivRoundingUp)

### Internal Pre-conditions

{User or Protocol} uses mulDiv() or mulDivRoundingUp() with inputs that would overflow a 256-bit multiplication or increment if unchecked.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls a function that depends on FullMath.mulDiv() or mulDivRoundingUp() with large values.
2. Internally, the multiplication or increment triggers a revert due to overflow.
3. The whole transaction fails—even if the math would’ve been correct using wrapping logic.

### Impact

The protocol cannot perform valid high-precision calculations with large numbers.
This causes:
- Unexpected transaction reverts.
- Denial of service to users in high-liquidity scenarios.
- Incompatibility with protocols using large integer math (e.g. Uniswap-style price or tick math).

### PoC

```solidity
function testMulDivRevertsOnLargeInput() public {
    uint256 a = type(uint256).max / 2 + 1;
    uint256 b = type(uint256).max / 2 + 1;
    uint256 denominator = 2;

    vm.expectRevert(); // Expected to revert due to overflow in mul
    FullMath.mulDiv(a, b, denominator);
}
```

### Mitigation

Wrap all arithmetic in the following functions inside unchecked { ... }:

- FullMath.mulDiv
- FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp
- FullMath.mulDivX256
- FullMath.mulX128
- FullMath.mulX256

This aligns behavior with Solidity <0.8.0 and matches expectations from Uniswap's design.
