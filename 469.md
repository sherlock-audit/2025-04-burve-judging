# Missing slippage protection in addValue/removeValue

### Summary

In the Burve protocol, users can add or remove value to or from a given closure. This allows them to provide liquidity to subsets of tokens that accrue rewards. However, a problem arises because there is no slippage protection for these two main entry points. Unlike other functions in the contract (e.g., addValueSingle with maxRequired or removeValueSingle with minReceive), these functions do not include parameters that allow users to specify acceptable limits for their transactions.

### Root Cause

No slippage protection on addValue and removeValue

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. Frontrunning addValue/removeValue(accidentally or intentionally)

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Users may receive significantly fewer tokens than expected or pay significantly more than expected.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection to addValue/removeValue functions in the ValueFacet
