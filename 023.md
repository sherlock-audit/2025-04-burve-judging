# Division By Zero Vulnerability in ValueLib.x Function

## Summary
The `x` function in the ValueLib library contains a critical division by zero vulnerability that can occur when the `vX128` parameter equals `etX128 + 2 * tX128`. This deterministic bug will cause transactions to revert, potentially blocking critical protocol operations like swaps and liquidity provision, and could lead to permanent loss of funds in certain scenarios.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `x` function of the ValueLib library, there is a calculation that computes a denominator as `etX128 + 2 * tX128 - vX128`. If `vX128` equals `etX128 + 2 * tX128`, this denominator becomes zero, causing a division by zero error that will revert the transaction.

From `src/multi/Value.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Value.sol#L120-#L136:

```solidity
function x(
    uint256 tX128,
    uint256 eX128,
    uint256 vX128,
    bool roundUp
) internal pure returns (uint256 _x) {
    uint256 etX128 = FullMath.mulX128(eX128, tX128, roundUp);
    uint256 sqrtNumX128 = etX128 + tX128;
    // V is always less than (e + 2) * t
    uint256 denomX128 = etX128 + 2 * tX128 - vX128;
    uint256 xX128 = roundUp
        ? FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128)
        : FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128);
    xX128 -= etX128;
    _x = xX128 >> 128;
    if (roundUp && ((xX128 << 128) != 0)) _x += 1;
}
```

The code includes a comment claiming that "V is always less than (e + 2) * t", but no code actually enforces this condition. If `vX128` equals `etX128 + 2 * tX128`, the denominator `denomX128` will be zero, causing the subsequent `FullMath.mulDiv` or `FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp` call to revert with a division by zero error. It's important to note that this is not an overflow issue (which would be caught by Solidity 0.8+'s built-in overflow protection), but a genuine division by zero error that will always occur under the specific condition.

This vulnerability can be triggered in several ways:

1. When calculating token amounts in the `Closure.sol` contract's swap functions, particularly in `swapInExact` and `swapOutExact` where the `ValueLib.x` function is called to determine token balances based on value calculations

2. When determining token balances in liquidity provision operations, where the `ValueLib.x` function is used to convert between value and token amounts

3. When users interact with the protocol by performing swaps or adding/removing liquidity with specific amounts that result in this edge case

The `vX128` parameter is derived from various sources including user inputs (swap amounts), pool balances, and internal calculations. While often computed internally, `vX128` can be influenced by external factors such as:

- Oracle prices that feed into value calculations
- Pool balances that change due to user operations
- User-submitted amounts during swaps or liquidity operations
- Accumulated fees or rebasing effects

These inputs can realistically align with `etX128 + 2 * tX128`, especially with rounding errors or manipulated external values. Since there's no validation to prevent this condition, it's only a matter of time before a transaction hits this edge case.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Transaction Failures**: Any transaction that calls the `x` function with `vX128` equal to `etX128 + 2 * tX128` will revert, preventing users from completing critical operations.

2. **Denial of Service**: If this condition occurs in core protocol functions, it could render parts of the protocol unusable.

3. **Permanent Fund Loss**: If funds are transferred to a contract before a swap executes, and the swap reverts due to this bug, those funds may become inaccessible if no withdrawal mechanism exists. For example, if a user deposits tokens into a contract that then attempts to swap them using the Burve protocol, and the swap reverts due to this division by zero, the user's funds could be permanently locked in the contract.

4. **Protocol Instability**: The unpredictable nature of when this condition might occur creates instability in the protocol's operation, especially during high volatility periods when users need the protocol most.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur under specific conditions
- It affects core mathematical calculations used throughout the protocol
- It can lead to transaction failures and potential fund loss
- It has no workaround once the condition is met

## Proof of Concept
This vulnerability can be demonstrated mathematically by analyzing the code in the `x` function. The `ValueLib.x` function is used extensively throughout the protocol, particularly in the following critical operations:

1. In `Closure.sol`'s `swapInExact` function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L381-#L434), which is called by `SwapFacet.swap` when users perform swaps with exact input:
   ```solidity
   uint256 newOutBalance = ValueLib.x(
       self.targetX128,
       esX128[outIdx],
       newOutValueX128,
       true
   );
   ```

2. In `Closure.sol`'s `swapOutExact` function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L438-#L494), which is called by `SwapFacet.swap` when users perform swaps with exact output:
   ```solidity
   uint256 newInBalance = ValueLib.x(
       self.targetX128,
       esX128[inIdx],
       newInValueX128,
       false
   );
   ```

3. In `Closure.sol`'s `simSwapInExact` and `simSwapOutExact` functions, which are used to simulate swaps and calculate price impacts.

4. In various liquidity provision operations throughout the protocol.

The vulnerability in the `x` function can be analyzed as follows:

```solidity
function x(
    uint256 tX128,
    uint256 eX128,
    uint256 vX128,
    bool roundUp
) internal pure returns (uint256 _x) {
    uint256 etX128 = FullMath.mulX128(eX128, tX128, roundUp);
    uint256 sqrtNumX128 = etX128 + tX128;
    // V is always less than (e + 2) * t
    uint256 denomX128 = etX128 + 2 * tX128 - vX128;
    uint256 xX128 = roundUp
        ? FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128)
        : FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128);
    xX128 -= etX128;
    _x = xX128 >> 128;
    if (roundUp && ((xX128 << 128) != 0)) _x += 1;
}
```

Let's analyze what happens when `vX128` equals `etX128 + 2 * tX128`:

1. `etX128` is calculated as `FullMath.mulX128(eX128, tX128, roundUp)`
2. `denomX128` is calculated as `etX128 + 2 * tX128 - vX128`
3. If `vX128 = etX128 + 2 * tX128`, then `denomX128 = 0`
4. The next line calls either `FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp` or `FullMath.mulDiv`, both of which will revert with a division by zero error when the denominator is zero

To demonstrate this with concrete values:

- Let `tX128 = 100 << 128` (some arbitrary target value)
- Let `eX128 = 50 << 128` (some arbitrary efficiency factor)
- `etX128` would be approximately `50 * 100 = 5000` (simplified for clarity)
- `etX128 + 2 * tX128` would be `5000 + 2 * 100 = 5200`
- If `vX128 = 5200`, then `denomX128 = 5200 - 5200 = 0`
- This causes a division by zero in the subsequent `FullMath.mulDiv` call

This vulnerability is particularly concerning because the comment in the code states "V is always less than (e + 2) * t", but there's no actual check to enforce this constraint. This means that if any calling function provides a `vX128` value that equals `etX128 + 2 * tX128`, the transaction will revert with a division by zero error.

The vulnerability can be triggered in real-world scenarios when:

1. A user performs a swap that results in a token balance calculation where `vX128` equals `etX128 + 2 * tX128`
2. A liquidity provider adds or removes liquidity in a way that triggers this edge case
3. The protocol's internal calculations reach this edge case during normal operations

In each of these scenarios, the transaction would unexpectedly revert, potentially causing users to lose gas fees and preventing critical protocol operations from completing.

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of validation to ensure that `vX128` is strictly less than `etX128 + 2 * tX128`. While the code includes a comment indicating this constraint, it fails to actually enforce it, allowing the denominator to potentially become zero.

This is a classic case of a missing input validation check for a critical mathematical operation.

## Code Snippet
From `src/multi/Value.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Value.sol#L120-#L136 :

```solidity
function x(
    uint256 tX128,
    uint256 eX128,
    uint256 vX128,
    bool roundUp
) internal pure returns (uint256 _x) {
    uint256 etX128 = FullMath.mulX128(eX128, tX128, roundUp);
    uint256 sqrtNumX128 = etX128 + tX128;
    // V is always less than (e + 2) * t
    uint256 denomX128 = etX128 + 2 * tX128 - vX128;
    uint256 xX128 = roundUp
        ? FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128)
        : FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128);
    xX128 -= etX128;
    _x = xX128 >> 128;
    if (roundUp && ((xX128 << 128) != 0)) _x += 1;
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
Add an explicit check to ensure that `vX128` is strictly less than `etX128 + 2 * tX128`:

```solidity
function x(
    uint256 tX128,
    uint256 eX128,
    uint256 vX128,
    bool roundUp
) internal pure returns (uint256 _x) {
    uint256 etX128 = FullMath.mulX128(eX128, tX128, roundUp);
    uint256 maxVX128 = etX128 + 2 * tX128;

    // Enforce the constraint mentioned in the comment
    require(vX128 < maxVX128, "ValueLib: vX128 must be less than (e + 2) * t");

    uint256 sqrtNumX128 = etX128 + tX128;
    uint256 denomX128 = maxVX128 - vX128;
    uint256 xX128 = roundUp
        ? FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128)
        : FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128);
    xX128 -= etX128;
    _x = xX128 >> 128;
    if (roundUp && ((xX128 << 128) != 0)) _x += 1;
}
```

Alternatively, if there's a valid reason why `vX128` might equal `etX128 + 2 * tX128`, handle this edge case explicitly:

```solidity
function x(
    uint256 tX128,
    uint256 eX128,
    uint256 vX128,
    bool roundUp
) internal pure returns (uint256 _x) {
    uint256 etX128 = FullMath.mulX128(eX128, tX128, roundUp);
    uint256 maxVX128 = etX128 + 2 * tX128;

    // Handle the edge case
    if (vX128 >= maxVX128) {
        return type(uint256).max; // Or some other appropriate value
    }

    uint256 sqrtNumX128 = etX128 + tX128;
    uint256 denomX128 = maxVX128 - vX128;
    uint256 xX128 = roundUp
        ? FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128)
        : FullMath.mulDiv(sqrtNumX128, sqrtNumX128, denomX128);
    xX128 -= etX128;
    _x = xX128 >> 128;
    if (roundUp && ((xX128 << 128) != 0)) _x += 1;
}
```
