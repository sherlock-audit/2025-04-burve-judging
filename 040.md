# Unreliable bgtBalance Tracking Causes Fund Lock and Incorrect Exchange Logic

### Summary

The BGTExchanger contract tracks available BGT tokens using an internal variable bgtBalance, which is only updated when tokens are deposited via the fund() function. However, if BGT tokens are sent directly to the contract via standard ERC20 transfers, this balance is not updated. As a result, the contract may incorrectly calculate the available BGT for exchanges, leading to failed or underpaid swaps, and potentially causing permanent locking of user or protocol funds within the contract

### Root Cause

The internal accounting variable bgtBalance is manually incremented only inside the fund() function:

```solidity
function fund(uint256 amount) external {
    bgtBalance += amount;
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
        bgtToken,
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
}
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L19
```
However, direct ERC20 transfers to the contract (e.g., using transfer() externally) do not update this variable. This leads to a mismatch between the actual token balance in the contract and the internally tracked balance used by logic such as viewExchange() and exchange()

### Internal Pre-conditions

- bgtBalance is used to determine how much BGT can be exchanged
- viewExchange() and exchange() rely solely on bgtBalance for logic
- There is no fallback logic that checks IERC20(bgtToken).balanceOf(address(this))



### External Pre-conditions

- An administrator, automated script, or external user mistakenly transfers BGT to the contract without using the fund() function
- Frontend or integrator assumes that transferred tokens are usable for swaps
- No audit or monitoring mechanism detects discrepancies between bgtBalance and the actual balance

### Attack Path

1. An operator sends 1,000,000 BGT directly to the contract using bgtToken.transfer(address(exchanger), 1_000_000 ether);
2. Since fund() is not called, bgtBalance is unchanged and remains at 0.
3. When a user later calls exchange(), the viewExchange() logic sees that bgtBalance == 0 and returns bgtAmount == 0, even though the contract does have tokens.
4. The user is either denied a valid swap or receives a reduced amount.
5. The transferred tokens remain permanently unused unless manually recovered via sendBalance().

### Impact

> BGT tokens sent to the contract without using fund() are not recognized by internal accounting, resulting in incorrect availability checks during swaps. This can cause:

- Exchange operations to fail despite sufficient liquidity
- Users receiving less BGT than expected
- Tokens remaining permanently locked in the contract, causing economic loss to users or protocol funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use IERC20(bgtToken).balanceOf(address(this)); in the viewExchange()
