# The contract blindly trusts the stationProxy for LP deposits/withdrawals. A malicious proxy could steal funds

### Summary

the owner to migrate to a new stationProxy without safeguards. A malicious or compromised proxy can steal user-owned island shares (LP tokens) during deposits/withdrawals. This occurs because the contract:

1.Grants the proxy unlimited approval to transfer island shares.

2.Does not validate the trustworthiness of the new proxy during migration.

### Root Cause

- In Bruve.sol:208 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L208

The migrateStationProxy function lacks:

Timelock: Immediate migration enables sudden rug-pulls.

Governance Checks: A single owner can unilaterally change the proxy.

Re-Entrancy Guards: No protection against malicious proxies manipulating state during migration.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Owner Privilege: The contract owner can call `migrateStationProxy`.

Proxy Approval: The contract grants `stationProxy` unlimited approval to transfer island shares (SafeERC20.forceApprove).

### External Pre-conditions

Malicious Proxy Deployment: An attacker deploys a proxy contract with a malicious ``depositLP/withdrawLP`` implementation.

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

Direct Loss: All island shares (and underlying tokens) managed by the proxy can be stolen.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Timelock:

Implement a 24â€“72 hour delay for migrateStationProxy to allow users to exit.

Emit an event on migration initiation to alert users.
