# The absence of a minimum–output  share check will cause asset loss for liquidity providers due to slippage

### Summary

Omitting any slippage or minimum-share validation in mintIsland will cause net token loss for liquidity providers, as market price shifts (or an attacker sandwich) can occur between the on-chain price quote and the actual island mint—resulting in fewer shares (or more token input) than expected.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226-L344

In mintIsland the contract:

Reads the current sqrt-price (slot0()).

Computes amount0/amount1 via getAmountsForLiquidity.

Calls island.getMintAmounts(amount0, amount1) and then island.mint(mintShares, …)
without any check that mintShares meets a user-specified minimum (or that amount0/amount1 stay within acceptable slippage bounds).



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A liquidity provider calls mint(...) with mintNominalLiq > 0.
2. Execution enters mintIsland(...) for an island range.
3. No internal code path enforces a minimum mintShares or maximum amount0/amount1 slippage.


### External Pre-conditions

The Uniswap pool’s price (slot0().sqrtRatioX96) can move adversely between the quote and the mint.

### Attack Path

1. user invokes mint(recipient, mintNominalLiq, lower, upper).
2. mintIsland snapshots sqrtRatioX96 and computes amount0/amount1.
3. Before island.mint(...), the price shifts (via market trades or MEV).
4. island.mint executes at the new ratio, producing fewer mintShares (or consuming more tokens) than the LP expected.
5. LP receives less value—or pays more—than the original quote implied.



### Impact

Liquidity Providers incur slippage losses: they end up with fewer island shares or overpay in token amounts, reducing their overall position value.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

implement an share amount check that was minted when depositing the token
