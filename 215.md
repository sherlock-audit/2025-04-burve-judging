# Incorrect Remainder Calculation in mulDivX256

### Summary

The incorrect remainder calculation in `mulDivX256` will cause significant precision loss for the protocol as an attacker will exploit inaccurate arithmetic results to manipulate financial calculations, such as token swaps or liquidity provisions.

### Root Cause

In `FullMath.sol`, the remainder calculation for (num * X128 * X128) % denominator uses two sequential mulmod operations:

```solidity

uint256 remainder;
assembly {
    remainder := mulmod(num, X128, denominator)
    remainder := mulmod(remainder, X128, denominator)
}


```
This approach is mathematically incorrect. The first mulmod computes (num * X128) % denominator, producing a reduced value. The second mulmod then multiplies this remainder by X128 and takes the modulus again, resulting in a value that does not represent the true remainder of (num * X128 * X128) % denominator. The correct remainder should be computed using a single operation or proper decomposition of the 512-bit product, as done in the mulDiv function. This error leads to an inaccurate remainder, which propagates through subsequent calculations, causing precision loss in the function’s output.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Caller needs to invoke `mulDivX256` to set num to be at least 2^128 to amplify the impact of precision loss.

Caller needs to invoke `mulDivX256` to set denominator to be other than a multiple of 2^128 to ensure the remainder calculation is non-trivial.

Caller needs to invoke `mulDivX256` in a context where the result is used for critical financial calculations (e.g., pricing or liquidity).

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Attacker identifies a  protocol (e.g., a Uniswap V3-like pool) that uses `mulDivX256` for calculating swap prices or liquidity shares.

Attacker crafts input values for num and denominator  to maximize the precision error in the remainder calculation.

Attacker calls a protocol function that invokes `mulDivX256`, triggering the incorrect remainder calculation.

The incorrect remainder leads to a miscalculated result, such as an inflated swap output or incorrect liquidity share allocation.

Attacker repeats the process across multiple transactions to accumulate excess tokens or shares, exploiting the precision error.

### Impact

The  protocol suffers an approximate loss of up to 1-5% of the affected pool’s liquidity due to precision errors, depending on input values. The attacker gains this excess liquidity, potentially worth thousands of ETH in high-value pools.

### PoC

Consider a  protocol using `mulDivX256` to calculate the output amount of token B for a given input amount of token A in a swap, based on a price ratio. The protocol calls mulDivX256 to compute:

```solidity

outputAmount = (inputAmount * X128 * X128) / priceDenominator

```

where X128 = 2^128, inputAmount is the amount of token A, and priceDenominator is derived from the pool’s reserves.

Inputs

num = inputAmount = 1000 (representing 1000 units of token A, scaled appropriately).

denominator = priceDenominator = 100 (representing a price ratio).

X128 = 2^128.

roundUp = true (to ensure ceiling division).

Actual Behavior

The mulDivX256 function computes the remainder as follows:

First mulmod:

```solidity

remainder = (1000 * 2^128) % 100


```
Since 1000 * 2^128 is a large multiple of 100, this yields remainder = 0.

Second mulmod:

```solidity
remainder = (0 * 2^128) % 100 = 0

```

The incorrect remainder = 0 is used, leading to:

No adjustment to num (since gt(remainder, 0) = 0).

No rounding (since roundUp = roundUp && (remainder > 0) = false).

The result is computed using an incorrect fractional component, deviating from the expected value. For example, if the true remainder is 50, the protocol might underpay the output amount by failing to round up, or overpay if the incorrect remainder triggers rounding inappropriately in other cases

### Mitigation

Replace the flawed remainder calculation with a 512-bit multiplication approach, leveraging the existing mul512 function to handle the full product:

```solidity

uint256 remainder;
(uint256 bot, uint256 top) = FullMath.mul512(num, X128); // Compute num * X128
(bot, top) = FullMath.mul512(bot, X128); // Compute (num * X128) * X128
assembly {
    remainder := mulmod(bot, 1, denominator) // Compute remainder of full product
}

```

Explanation


The mul512 function computes a 512-bit product (num * X128) as (bot, top), where bot is the lower 256 bits and top is the upper 256 bits.

The second mul512 computes (bot * X128), producing the full 512-bit product (num * X128 * X128).

The mulmod(bot, 1, denominator) computes the remainder of the lower 256 bits modulo denominator. Since top represents the higher bits, it is typically zero or irrelevant for the remainder if num * X128 * X128 fits within 256 bits after modulo (ensured by the precondition denominator > num).

This approach ensures the remainder is computed correctly, avoiding the precision loss from sequential mulmod operations.
