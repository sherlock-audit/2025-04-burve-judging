# Balance is updated but rate still stays thesame

## Summary
The `exchange` function Requests the specified token and amount in exchange for bgt at the set rate. The BGT is not given immediately, instead the caller has a right for which they can withdraw. By keeping the BGT on this contract, we have more flexibility for migrations, or staking, However the rate of intoken stays the same after exchanging of tokens .

## Vulnerability Details
```solidity
 /// @inheritdoc IBGTExchanger
    function viewExchange(
   @>     address inToken,
        uint128 amount
    ) public view returns (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) {
        // If rate is zero, the spendAmount remains zero.
        bgtAmount = FullMath.mulX128(rate[inToken], amount, false);

        if (bgtBalance < bgtAmount) {
            bgtAmount = bgtBalance;
            // Rate won't be zero here or else bgtAmount is 0 and can't be more.
            amount = uint128(
                FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(bgtAmount, 1 << 128, rate[inToken])
            );
        }

        if (bgtAmount != 0) {
            spendAmount = amount;
        }
    }
```
As we can see it uses the intoken to calculate the amount of bgt rate to receive for the user however it does not update rate of tokens after swap allowing for linear swaps without updating rate for different tokens after swaps. Even when price of `intokens` drop rate stays thesame
## Impact 
Wrong amount of bgt rate would be earned from `inToken` with lower price or drop in price of the token
## Recommended Mitigation
Update rate of tokens
