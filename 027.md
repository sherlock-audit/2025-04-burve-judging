# Vault Migration Vulnerability in VaultLib.hotSwap Can Lead to Permanent Fund Loss

## Summary
The `hotSwap` function in the VaultLib library contains a critical vulnerability that can lead to permanent loss of funds during vault migrations. This deterministic bug occurs because the function swaps the active and backup vaults without properly transferring existing balances, potentially leaving funds inaccessible in the old vault.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `hotSwap` function of the VaultLib library, there is a mechanism to swap the active vault with the backup vault for a given vertex. However, the function simply swaps the pointers to the vaults without ensuring that all funds have been transferred from the old active vault to the new one.

From `src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L113-L125:

```solidity
/// Swap the active vault we deposit into.
function hotSwap(
    VertexId vid
) internal returns (address fromVault, address toVault) {
    VaultStorage storage vStore = Store.vaults();
    // If there is no backup, then we can't do this.
    if (vStore.backups[vid] == address(0)) revert NoBackup(vid);
    // Swap.
    address active = vStore.vaults[vid];
    address backup = vStore.backups[vid];
    vStore.vaults[vid] = backup;
    vStore.backups[vid] = active;
    return (active, backup);
}
```

The issue is that this function only swaps the vault pointers without checking if there are still funds in the old active vault. After the swap, new deposits will go to the new active vault (previously the backup), but existing funds in the old active vault (now the backup) remain there.

This becomes problematic because:

1. The `VaultProxyImpl.deposit` function only deposits into the active vault:

```solidity
/// We simply deposit into the active vault pointer.
function deposit(
    VaultProxy memory self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    self.active.deposit(cid, amount);
}
```

2. The `VaultProxyImpl.withdraw` function attempts to withdraw from the active vault first, and only falls back to the backup if the active vault doesn't have enough funds:

```solidity
/// Withdraw from the active vault, and then the backup if we can't fulfill it entirely.
function withdraw(
    VaultProxy memory self,
    ClosureId cid,
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // We effectively don't allow withdraws beyond uint128 due to the capping in balance.
    uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
    uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
    if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

    if (amount > available) {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
        self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available);
    } else {
        self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
    }
}
```

While this withdrawal logic does check the backup vault if needed, there's a critical issue: if the protocol later removes the backup vault (which is now the old active vault), any funds still in that vault will be permanently lost. The `VaultLib.remove` function only checks if the vault has a small balance before allowing removal:

```solidity
function remove(address vault) internal {
    VaultPointer memory vPtr = getVault(vault);
    uint256 outstanding = vPtr.totalBalance(false);
    if (outstanding > BALANCE_DE_MINIMUS)
        revert RemainingVaultBalance(outstanding);

    VaultStorage storage vStore = Store.vaults();
    VertexId vid = vStore.usedBy[vault];
    if (vStore.vaults[vid] == vault) revert VaultInUse(vault, vid);

    // We are not the active vault, so we're the backup and we have no tokens. Okay to remove.
    delete vStore.backups[vid];

    VaultType vType = vStore.vTypes[vault];
    delete vStore.vTypes[vault];
    // Vault specific operation.
    if (vType == VaultType.E4626) vStore.e4626s[vault].del();
    else revert VaultTypeNotRecognized(vType);
    // VertexId delete.
    vStore.usedBy[vault] = VertexId.wrap(0);
}
```

The `BALANCE_DE_MINIMUS` constant is set to 10, which means that if the vault has more than 10 tokens, it cannot be removed. However, if the vault has exactly 10 tokens or fewer, it can be removed, potentially leading to the loss of those tokens.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Permanent Fund Loss**: If a vault migration is performed without first transferring all funds from the old active vault to the new one, and then the old vault is removed, any remaining funds in the old vault will be permanently lost.

2. **Protocol Instability**: The inconsistent state between vaults can lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol, potentially affecting other operations.

3. **User Trust Loss**: Users may lose trust in the protocol if they discover that their funds have been lost due to a vault migration.

4. **Operational Complexity**: Protocol operators must manually ensure that all funds are transferred before performing a vault migration, which increases operational complexity and the risk of human error.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur if a vault with funds is removed
- It directly leads to permanent loss of funds
- It affects a core function of the protocol (vault management)
- It has no automatic recovery mechanism

## Proof of Concept
Consider the following scenario:

1. A vertex has an active vault A with 1000 tokens and a backup vault B with 0 tokens.
2. The protocol operator calls `hotSwap` to make vault B the active vault and vault A the backup vault.
3. New deposits go to vault B, but the 1000 tokens remain in vault A (now the backup).
4. The protocol operator wants to remove vault A (now the backup) but can't because it has more than `BALANCE_DE_MINIMUS` tokens.
5. The protocol operator manually transfers most of the tokens from vault A to vault B using the `transferBalance` function, leaving only 5 tokens in vault A.
6. The protocol operator calls `removeVault` on vault A, which succeeds because the remaining balance (5 tokens) is less than `BALANCE_DE_MINIMUS` (10 tokens).
7. The 5 tokens in vault A are now permanently lost because the vault has been removed from the protocol.

This scenario is not theoretical - it's a realistic sequence of operations that could occur during a vault migration, especially if the protocol operator is not aware of the need to transfer all funds before removing a vault.

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper fund management during vault migrations. The `hotSwap` function only swaps the vault pointers without ensuring that all funds have been transferred from the old active vault to the new one. Additionally, the `remove` function allows vaults with small balances to be removed, potentially leading to the loss of those funds.

## Code Snippet
From `src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L113-L125:

```solidity
/// Swap the active vault we deposit into.
function hotSwap(
    VertexId vid
) internal returns (address fromVault, address toVault) {
    VaultStorage storage vStore = Store.vaults();
    // If there is no backup, then we can't do this.
    if (vStore.backups[vid] == address(0)) revert NoBackup(vid);
    // Swap.
    address active = vStore.vaults[vid];
    address backup = vStore.backups[vid];
    vStore.vaults[vid] = backup;
    vStore.backups[vid] = active;
    return (active, backup);
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several approaches to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Automatic Fund Transfer**: Modify the `hotSwap` function to automatically transfer all funds from the old active vault to the new one before swapping the pointers:

```solidity
/// Swap the active vault we deposit into.
function hotSwap(
    VertexId vid
) internal returns (address fromVault, address toVault) {
    VaultStorage storage vStore = Store.vaults();
    // If there is no backup, then we can't do this.
    if (vStore.backups[vid] == address(0)) revert NoBackup(vid);
    
    // Get the vault addresses
    address active = vStore.vaults[vid];
    address backup = vStore.backups[vid];
    
    // Transfer all funds from active to backup for all closures
    // This would require iterating through all closures and transferring their balances
    
    // Swap the vaults
    vStore.vaults[vid] = backup;
    vStore.backups[vid] = active;
    
    return (active, backup);
}
```

2. **Zero Balance Requirement**: Require that the active vault has a zero balance before allowing a hot swap:

```solidity
/// Swap the active vault we deposit into.
function hotSwap(
    VertexId vid
) internal returns (address fromVault, address toVault) {
    VaultStorage storage vStore = Store.vaults();
    // If there is no backup, then we can't do this.
    if (vStore.backups[vid] == address(0)) revert NoBackup(vid);
    
    // Get the active vault
    address active = vStore.vaults[vid];
    
    // Check that the active vault has a zero balance
    VaultPointer memory vPtr = getVault(active);
    uint256 outstanding = vPtr.totalBalance(false);
    require(outstanding == 0, "Active vault must have zero balance");
    
    // Swap the vaults
    address backup = vStore.backups[vid];
    vStore.vaults[vid] = backup;
    vStore.backups[vid] = active;
    
    return (active, backup);
}
```

3. **Prevent Vault Removal with Any Balance**: Modify the `remove` function to prevent removing a vault with any balance, not just balances above `BALANCE_DE_MINIMUS`:

```solidity
function remove(address vault) internal {
    VaultPointer memory vPtr = getVault(vault);
    uint256 outstanding = vPtr.totalBalance(false);
    if (outstanding > 0)
        revert RemainingVaultBalance(outstanding);

    VaultStorage storage vStore = Store.vaults();
    VertexId vid = vStore.usedBy[vault];
    if (vStore.vaults[vid] == vault) revert VaultInUse(vault, vid);

    // We are not the active vault, so we're the backup and we have no tokens. Okay to remove.
    delete vStore.backups[vid];

    VaultType vType = vStore.vTypes[vault];
    delete vStore.vTypes[vault];
    // Vault specific operation.
    if (vType == VaultType.E4626) vStore.e4626s[vault].del();
    else revert VaultTypeNotRecognized(vType);
    // VertexId delete.
    vStore.usedBy[vault] = VertexId.wrap(0);
}
```

Option 1 or 2 is recommended as they provide the most comprehensive protection against fund loss during vault migrations.
