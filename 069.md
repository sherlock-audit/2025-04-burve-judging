# Attacker will corrupt inverse computation and break precision logic in FullMath.sol::mulDivX256

### Summary

Incorrect use of the ^ (bitwise XOR) operator instead of exponentiation in **FullMath.sol** at [line 177](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L177C7-L177C49) will cause the Newton-Raphson modular inverse to be initialized with the wrong seed, resulting in an invalid or broken modular inverse.

This causes incorrect arithmetic in `fullmath::mulDivX256()`, which in turn can break precision guarantees for all asset/share conversions, especially when used in vaults such  E4626.sol.

As a result, users can be prevented from fully withdrawing due to rounding issues, and the protocol may experience cumulative accounting inaccuracies.

### Root Cause

In [FullMath.sol:177](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L177C7-L177C49) the initial inverse seed is incorrectly computed using bitwise XOR instead of exponentiation:

```solidity 

uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;
```

This is incorrect. The original algorithm by Remco Bloemen expects:

```solidity 

uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ** 2; // i.e. 9 * denominator * denominator
```

Solidity does not support exponentiation with `^` â€” it treats this as bitwise XOR, which will produce incorrect values, rendering the modular inverse process invalid.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `mulDivX256()` must be invoked with non-zero denominator and `num <` denominator.
2. The incorrect inverse value `(inv)` must be used in an arithmetic operation relying on accurate modular inversion.
3. The result of the operation must be used downstream in core asset/share accounting `(e.g., as seen in E4626.sol::balance()).`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Protocol or vault (like E4626) must use FullMath.mulDivX256() or mulDiv() for asset/share conversions.
3. A user (attacker or not) initiates a withdrawal or deposit with small share amounts, amplifying rounding error side effects.

### Attack Path

1. A user (Alice) interacts with a vault using `FullMath.mulDivX256()` for precision share calculations.
3. Due to the corrupted modular inverse, the calculation returns a slightly incorrect value.
5. That value is used to compute how many shares Alice can withdraw.
7. Precision mismatch prevents full withdrawal; Alice's shares are stuck
9. Alternatively, over long use, these errors can accumulate, `breaking NAV-based logic` or `share:asset invariants`.

### Impact

The users suffer from rounding issues that prevent full withdrawals, leading to **unclaimable dust shares.**

**In worst cases:**

-  Funds can become permanently stuck.
-   The protocol breaks accounting invariants.

These errors are hard to detect because they manifest at edge cases (small deposits/withdrawals), and do not revert.

### PoC



```solidity
function test_BrokenInverseCausesRoundingError() public {
    uint256 denominator = 3e18; // Example large number
    uint256 num = 1e18;

    // This should compute num * X128 / denominator precisely
    uint256 correctResult = FullMath.mulDiv(num, FullMath.X128, denominator);

    // But mulDivX256 has a broken inverse seed due to ^2 (bitwise XOR)
    uint256 badResult = FullMath.mulDivX256(num, denominator, false);

    // Show difference
    console.log("Correct: ", correctResult);
    console.log("Broken : ", badResult);

    assertGt(correctResult, badResult); // Will show loss of precision
}

```
### Mitigation

Fix the inverse seed initialization at -`FullMath.sol::177` by replacing the ^ operator with multiplication:

**Replace**
```solidity
uint256 inv = (3 * denominator) ^ 2;
```
**With**
```solidity
uint256 x = 3 * denominator;
uint256 inv = x * x;
```
