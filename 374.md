# User can take pending rewards by moving the positions out of range

### Summary

When depositing assets through `Burve.sol::mint`, the contract first compounds any pending fees accrued into `totalNominalLiquidity` to ensure that the deposit reflects the correct shares-to-liquidity ratio. Similarly, when a withdrawal is performed, the compounding logic is executed again to ensure users can withdraw their fair share, including any compounded liquidity.

However, when calculating the compounded liquidity, the contract evaluates the return from each range using a fixed `1 << 64` liquidity unit, dividing collected balances by these values to estimate the liquidity received:

```solidity
uint256 nominalLiq0 =
    amount0InUnitLiqX64 > 0 ? (collected0 << 64) / amount0InUnitLiqX64 : uint256(type(uint128).max);

uint256 nominalLiq1 =
    amount1InUnitLiqX64 > 0 ? (collected1 << 64) / amount1InUnitLiqX64 : uint256(type(uint128).max);

uint256 unsafeNominalLiq = nominalLiq0 < nominalLiq1 ? nominalLiq0 : nominalLiq1;
```

The compounded liquidity is taken as the lesser of `nominalLiq0` and `nominalLiq1`. This approach enables an attacker to intentionally push one of the Uniswap V3 ranges out of range. This ensures not all liquidity is compounded, allowing them to reset the pool and later claim rewards from the compounded portion.

### Root Cause

In `collectAndCalcCompound`, liquidity is calculated over all ranges indiscriminately. However, some ranges might be out of range, allowing users to manipulate the state to avoid full compounding and subsequently profit by realigning the pool to capture the full compounded yield.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Compounding opportunities (i.e., pending fees) must exist prior to the attacker depositing.
2. The liquidity ranges must be manipulable to selectively push them out of range.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

* The in-range position holds 50 token0 / 50 token1.
* An out-of-range position holds either 0 token0 / 100 token1 or 100 token0 / 0 token1.
* Assume total fees accrued: 200 token0 and 200 token1.
* Let's say the in-range returns 50/50 and the out-of-range 0/100.

Calculations:

* `amount0InUnitLiqX64 = 50`
* `amount1InUnitLiqX64 = 150`
* `nominalLiq0 = (200 << 64) / 50 = 4`
* `nominalLiq1 = (200 << 64) / 150 = 1.33`
* `unsafeNominal = 1.33`

User deposits proportional liquidity:

* In-range: 0.665 of `unsafeNominal` => 33.25 token0 / 33.25 token1
* Out-of-range: 0.665 of `unsafeNominal` => 0 token0 / 66.5 token1

Post-deposit state:

* Remaining: 166.75 token0, 100 token1

User reverts pool to be within range and calls withdraw. Compounding is triggered again:

* Full compounding on 133.5 token0 and 133.5 token1

User can now withdraw, gaining a share of liquidity that they werenâ€™t entitled to prior to fees being accrued.

### Impact

An attacker can extract rewards without being a contributor to the fees that generated them, allowing for repeated exploitation and disproportionate yield extraction.

### PoC

*No response*

### Mitigation

Calculate and compound liquidity individually for each range to prevent disproportionate distribution of rewards. Only include ranges that are active and in-range when computing compounded liquidity to mitigate manipulation.
