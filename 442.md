# Rewards earned by the initial provided value can be significant and will be lost forever

### Summary

When the Diamond is first deployed, the contract is seeded with value. However, this value is not owned by anyone—this is to prevent inflation attacks. Still, there are many factors that affect the rewards calculation, and in such cases, the rewards earned by the dead shares can be very high and will be lost, since dead shares can't claim rewards.

### Root Cause

When users add value, they are granted value shares inside `Asset.sol`.
Users can also choose to receive rewards in the form of BGT or reserve shares. If lots of users choose to claim their rewards in BGT, then the reserve shares rewards for the initial value will be significant—and since they can't be claimed, they will be stuck.

Also, users can unstake their value and put it into other closure IDs.
If a closure’s `valueStaked` is very low because LPs found another closure to deposit value into—and since the value and the yield are not correlated—the yield earned by this closure will be distributed to dead shares, and the dead shares' portion will be very high.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users choose to receive their rewards in BGT or unstaked their value 


### External Pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

Happens naturally

### Impact

Rewards will be lost. Stakers will have diluted yield.

### PoC

**Textual PoC:**
Assume the initial value provided to the closure in deployment is 10.

Also assume that the closure now holds 100k value and all the stakers want to receive the yield in BGT. Hence, the yield for the non-BGT staker will be solely for the dead shares. And since the yield is big (too many tokens earning yield), the entire yield will flow to the dead shares, lost forever.

Another one: all users unstake (up to the allowed min) and the remaining users choose BGT for their reward. Again, unstaking doesn't mean the yield will be lesser since the underlying tokens are not transferred out. Dead shares again will accumulate a huge amount of fees although the value they provided is lesser.


### Mitigation

Make a function where the initial provided value can claim fees but not withdraw. This fee can be a type of protocol fee.
