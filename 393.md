# Critical Dust‑Offset Bug in collectAndCalcCompound May Disable Fee Compounding

### Summary

During the compounding process in `collectAndCalcCompound`, the code subtracts a corrective “dust” offset equal to `2 * distX96.length` from the computed nominal liquidity. An off‑by‑one in this subtraction logic can cause the entire compounding amount to be zeroed out—silently disabling fee compounding and starving liquidity providers of yields.

       function collectAndCalcCompound()
           internal
           returns (uint128 mintNominalLiq)
       {
           // …

           // Min calculated liquidity with the max allowed
           mintNominalLiq = unsafeNominalLiq > type(uint128).max
               ? type(uint128).max
               : uint128(unsafeNominalLiq);

           // during mint the liq at each range is rounded up
           // we subtract by the number of ranges to ensure we have enough liq
           mintNominalLiq = mintNominalLiq <= (2 * distX96.length)
               ? 0
               : mintNominalLiq - uint128(2 * distX96.length);
       }

The current dust‑offset approach risks zeroing out legitimate compounding yields.

### Root Cause

The method calculates `mintNominalLiq` as the minimum nominal liquidity that can be supported by the collected token amounts. To guard against rounding‑up inflation when splitting across n ranges, it then does:

       // during mint the liq at each range is rounded up
       // we subtract by the number of ranges to ensure we have enough liq
       mintNominalLiq = mintNominalLiq <= (2 * distX96.length)
           ? 0
           : mintNominalLiq - uint128(2 * distX96.length);

Here, `2 * distX96.length` is intended as a safe “dust” buffer, but its value is twice the number of ranges, not the exact worst‑case rounding error. If `mintNominalLiq` is calculated to exactly `2 * distX96.length + k` (for any small k), the subtraction will produce `k`. However, if it equals `2 * distX96.length` or below, the entire compound is zeroed—even when sufficient fees exist

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `distX96.length ≥ 1` (i.e., at least one V3 range).

2. Collected token amounts (`collected0`, `collected1`) non‑zero and below `2^192`.

3. Underlying Uniswap pool operations succeed and deposit tokens to this contract.



### External Pre-conditions

1. Periodic invocation of `compoundV3Ranges` via user calls to `mint` or `burn`.

2. Accumulated fee tokens on the contract exceed `2 * distX96.length`, but only marginally.

### Attack Path

1. Configuration: Deploy Burve with `n = distX96.length` ranges.

2. Fee Accumulation: Earn fees such that `collected0` and/or `collected1` produce `nominalLiq` just barely above `2 * n`.

3. Compounding: A call to `compoundV3Ranges` calculates `unsafeNominalLiq == 2 * n + ε` (where ε < 1 in nominal units).

4. Dust Subtraction: `mintNominalLiq = (2*n+ε) - 2*n = ε`, but since `ε < 1` and rounded to `uint128`, becomes `0`.

5. Outcome: Despite significant fees, `compoundV3Ranges` mints zero new liquidity, silently starving LPs.

### Impact

1. Revenue Loss: Liquidity providers lose all compounding yields for every invocation until `collected*` grows well beyond the dust buffer.

2. Silent Failure: No revert or warning is emitted; the system appears healthy while compounding simply stops.

### PoC

Given `distX96.length == 4`, dust buffer = 8. Suppose fees collected correspond to nominal liquidity of exactly 8.1 units (post‑shift). Solidity truncates to `uint128(8.1) == 8`. Then:

       unsafeNominalLiq = 8;
       mintNominalLiq = unsafeNominalLiq <= 8 ? 0 : unsafeNominalLiq - 8;  // => 0

Despite `0.1` units worth of fees—the result is zero.

### Mitigation

A precise, range‑aware buffer calculation or enforced minimum compound floor is strongly recommended.
