# Incorrect Order of Operations in commit functions leads to wrong withdrawal amount being processed.

### Summary

The incorrect order of operations in the commit function can lead to incorrect withdrawal amounts being processed, potentially causing loss of fee revenue and accounting error.

### Root Cause

In E4626.sol, commit function is used to perform batch operation of deposit and withdrawal. Inside the function, it net out assetsToWithdraw and assetsToDeposit to save some fees:
```solidity
 if (assetsToDeposit > 0 && assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
            // We can net out and save ourselves some fees.
            if (assetsToDeposit > assetsToWithdraw) {
                assetsToDeposit -= assetsToWithdraw;
                assetsToWithdraw = 0;
```
Problem arises when assetsToWithdraw is greater than assetsToDeposit [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L71-L73) because:

1.  assetsToDeposit is set to 0 first.
2. Then assetsToWithdraw attempts to subtract the now-zeroed assetsToDeposit
3. This means assetsToWithdraw remains unchanged instead of being properly reduced

```solidity
else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToDeposit = 0;                    // @audit Line 1
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;    // @audit Line 2
}
```

### Mitigation

Correct the order:
```solidity
else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;    // First subtract
    assetsToDeposit = 0;                    // Then zero out
}
```
