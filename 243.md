# # Incorrect withdrawals due to flawed netting logic in `commit()`

### Summary

## Summary
The `VaultE4626.commit()` function is designed to optimize vault operations by netting `deposits` against `withdrawals` before execution. However, the logic contains an error in the branch where `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`.

The current implementation incorrectly preserves the full withdrawal amount rather than properly netting the values, due to a flawed `subtraction` order. This bug causes:

Inaccurate updates to `totalVaultShares`

Potential imbalances in vault share accounting

Failure to achieve the intended optimization of netting opposing operations

### Root Cause

## Root Cause
In [`commit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L71-L74) function, the line `assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit` is placed after `assetsToDeposit` is set to `0`, causing the subtraction to always subtract zero. 
```solidity
            else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
>>              assetsToDeposit = 0;
                // @audit This subtracts 0 every time
>>              assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
            }
            ---snip---
            else if (assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
            // @audit incorrect share update
>>          self.totalVaultShares -= self.vault.withdraw(
                assetsToWithdraw,
                address(this),
                address(this)
            );
            }
```
his flaw completely bypasses the intended netting mechanism, resulting in:

The system processes full withdrawal amounts even when they should have been partially or fully offset by deposits.

### Internal Pre-conditions

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`
2. `assetsToDeposit > 0`
3. Vault contains sufficient assets for `withdraw()`

### External Pre-conditions

## External Pre-conditions
User attempts to deposit or withdraw that triggers `commit()` call.

### Attack Path

## Attack Path
1. Set `assetsToWithdraw = 100`, `assetsToDeposit = 70`
2. Call `commit()`
3. Code enters the `else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit)` branch
4.` assetsToDeposit = 0` is executed
5. `assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit` becomes `assetsToWithdraw -= 0`
6. Full `100` is withdrawn instead of the net `70`

### Impact

## Impact
This flaw bypasses deposit-withdrawal netting, causing inflated withdrawals and incorrect `totalVaultShares` accounting that desynchronizes the vault's ledger from its actual assets.

### PoC

### Poc
// (1) Add the following test in `test/multi/E4626.t.sol`:
```solidity
    // Add this import to the existing ones
    import {console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

    function testFlawedNettingInCommit() public {
        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(1);

        // First deposit
        {
            VaultTemp memory temp;
            vault.fetch(temp);
            vault.deposit(temp, cid, 2e10);
            vault.commit(temp);
            assertEq(vault.balance(temp, cid, false), 2e10);
        }

        // Small deposit + slightly larger withdraw (but not more than 2e10 total)
        {
            VaultTemp memory temp;
            vault.fetch(temp);
            vault.deposit(temp, cid, 1e9); // deposit 1e9
            vault.withdraw(temp, cid, 15e9); // withdraw 15e9 (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit)
            vault.commit(temp);
        }

        {
            VaultTemp memory temp;
            vault.fetch(temp);

            uint256 finalBalance = vault.balance(temp, cid, false);
            console.log("Final balance after netting:", finalBalance);

            // Expected balance: 2e10 - (15e9 - 1e9) = 6e9 which will not be the case
            
            // (assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit) = (assetsToWithdraw -= 0)
            // so it withdraws the whole 15e9 instead of 14e9 => This leaves 5e9 instead of 6e9
            assertNotEq(finalBalance, 6e9);
        }
    }
```
// (2) Run: `forge test --mt testFlawedNettingInCommit -vvvv`


### Mitigation

## Mitigation
Modify as follows:
```diff
            else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
-               assetsToDeposit = 0;
                assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
+               assetsToDeposit = 0;
            }
```
