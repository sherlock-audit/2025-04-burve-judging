# Misplaced Liquidity Outside Valid price Ranges limit resulting in capital inefficiency

### Summary

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L106-L124](url)

Although the withinSqrtPX96Limits modifier    ensures the current price is within the user’s specified tick range, the actual distribution of liquidity is driven by the static distx array. Critically:


distx is never updated during the mint call.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L242-L264](url)

Therefore, even if the price check passes, liquidity may be directed by stale weights to tick ranges outside the valid price window.

### Root Cause

Stale Distribution Weights:
distx[] defines how liquidity should be split across multiple tick ranges. Because the array remains outdated when calling mint ()  its weights can point to tick intervals that no longer align with the current market price.

```
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
            uint128 liqInRange = uint128(
                shift96(uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true)
            );


            if (liqInRange == 0) {
                continue;
            }


            TickRange memory range = ranges[i];
            if (range.isIsland()) {
                islandShares = mintIsland(recipient, liqInRange);
            } else {
                // mint the V3 ranges
                pool.mint(
                    address(this),
                    range.lower,
                    range.upper,
                    liqInRange,
                    abi.encode(msg.sender)
                );
            }
        }
```


The modifier enforces a price check against the specified range, but the  allocation logic blindly follows distx96, which references other ranges.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The distx[] array contains one or more weights pointing to tick ranges that do not include the current pool tick.
2. Mint() function is called  to add liquidity to positions  which adds liquidity to position outside the price range as defined by the tick range distribution weight as this weight is not updated on each Mint() function called 


### External Pre-conditions

1. The Uniswap pool’s active tick must lie outside at least one of the tick ranges referenced by distx[].

2. There must be non-zero liquidity allocated in distx96 for those out-of-range ticks.



### Attack Path

1. distx96[] with a weighted distribution that includes tick ranges A, B, and C is set up
2. Pool price shifts such that only range B is within range, while A and C fall outside the lower/upper tick bounds.
3. mint() is called with  range  B within price limit . The modifier check on [lower, upper] (covering B) passes.
4. The function iterates distx[] and naively adds liquidity into A, B, and C according to their weights.



### Impact

result in capital inefficiency as  liquidity is added to the range outside  price limit thereby violating the invariant

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the distx96[]weight  when calling the mint () function
