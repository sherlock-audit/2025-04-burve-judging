# `Closure::removeTokenForValue` miscalculates the debited value

### Summary
There is a rounding error in [Closure::removeTokenForValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L371) arising from a wrong conditional statement.

```solidity
    uint256 valueX128 = ((self.targetX128 - newTargetX128) * self.n);
    value = valueX128 >> 128;
    if ((value << 128) > 0) value += 1; // We need to round up.
```

This conditional statement always adds 1 to `value` except when `value` is less than 0 (i.e when valueX128 >> 128 == 0) which is very unlikely.

For instance, 

```solidity
    valueX128 = 1 << 128;
    value = valueX128 >> 128;  // value = 1

   // No rounding is required in this scenario
   // but the statement ` if ((value << 128) > 0) value += 1` will always add 1 to value making it 2.
   // This is always the case for almost all valid values of valueX128
```

### Impact
- More value is debited from user than required

### Mitigation
- The right statement would have been
```solidity
    if ((valueX128 & 1 << 128) > 0) value += 1;
```
