# Rounding correction does not reflect that Kodiak islands is not subject to redeposits

### Summary

When using `distX96.length` for rounding correction, if Kodiak Islands is set, the actual number of pool ranges being reinvested is `distX96.length -1`. Due to incorrect rounding correction, calculation errors occur.


### Root Cause


The `compoundV3Ranges` function collects interest earned from providing liquidity and reinvests it. When Kodiak Islands is used, its interest is excluded and is also excluded from reinvestment targets.

The `collectAndCalcCompound` function checks the collected interest and remaining balance, and returns the amount of liquidity that can be obtained when deposited in the pool. When calculating this, it applies a correction with `distX96.length` to prevent calculation discrepancies due to rounding. However, when using Kodiak Islands, since it's not a reinvestment target, the actual number of pool ranges being reinvested is `distX96.length -1`. This causes incorrect rounding correction and reduces calculation precision. The liquidity to be issued calculated by `collectAndCalcCompound` is measured to be less than actual.

```solidity
function collectAndCalcCompound()
    internal
    returns (uint128 mintNominalLiq)
{
    // collected amounts on the contract from: fees, compounded leftovers, or tokens sent to the contract.
    uint256 collected0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 collected1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this));

    ...

    // when split into n ranges the amount of tokens required can be rounded up
    // we need to make sure the collected amount allows for this rounding
    if (collected0 > distX96.length) {
@>      collected0 -= distX96.length;
    } else {
        collected0 = 0;
    }

    if (collected1 > distX96.length) {
@>      collected1 -= distX96.length;
    } else {
        collected1 = 0;
    }

    ...

    // during mint the liq at each range is rounded up
    // we subtract by the number of ranges to ensure we have enough liq
@>  mintNominalLiq = mintNominalLiq <= (2 * distX96.length)
        ? 0
        : mintNominalLiq - uint128(2 * distX96.length);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Kodiak Islands is enabled


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Call mint or burn to trigger reinvestment of interest into the UniV3 pool


### Impact

Attempts to reinvest less liquidity than actual amount. There is an error in the rounding correction, even though it was intentionally done to make the calculation accurate. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


When using Kodiak Islands, use `distX96.length - 1` instead of `distX96.length` for correction.
