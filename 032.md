# Incorrect Early Return in Reserve.withdraw Leads to Underflow and Hard Revert

## Summary
The `withdraw` function in the ReserveLib library contains a critical vulnerability where an early return doesn't prevent a subsequent state change, leading to an underflow error when `reserve.shares[idx]` is zero but `shares` is non-zero. This deterministic bug will cause transactions to revert, potentially blocking critical protocol operations like fee collection and withdrawals, and could lead to permanent loss of funds in certain scenarios.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `withdraw` function of the ReserveLib library, there is a critical logical flaw in how the function handles the case when `reserve.shares[idx]` is zero. The function includes an early return to avoid division by zero, but it fails to prevent a subsequent state change that causes an underflow error.

From `src/multi/vertex/Reserve.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Reserve.sol#L63-L79:

```solidity
/// Withdraw the redemption value of the given shares to this contract from the vault.
/// @dev We round down the redeemed value for safety reasons.
function withdraw(
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 shares
) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    Reserve storage reserve = Store.reserve();
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
    uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
    amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
    vProxy.withdraw(RESERVEID, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
    reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;
}
```

The issue is in the conditional check and subsequent state change:

```solidity
if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
// ... other code ...
reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;
```

While the early return guards against a division-by-zero scenario when `reserve.shares[idx] == 0`, it does not prevent an underflow in the case where `shares > reserve.shares[idx]`. There is no bounds check enforcing that the shares being withdrawn are less than or equal to what's available in the reserve, leading to a critical underflow.

When `reserve.shares[idx]` is non-zero but less than `shares`, the function will attempt to execute `reserve.shares[idx] -= shares`, which will cause an underflow error in Solidity 0.8.x, causing the transaction to revert.

This is a critical issue because it means that if `shares > reserve.shares[idx]` (including when `reserve.shares[idx]` is zero), the transaction will always revert, making it impossible to withdraw shares in these scenarios.

Additionally, there's a similar issue in the `query` function:

```solidity
function query(
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 shares
) internal view returns (uint256 amount) {
    Reserve storage reserve = Store.reserve();
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
    uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
    amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
}
```

While this function doesn't modify state and won't cause an underflow error, it will still return 0 even if `shares` is non-zero, which could lead to incorrect calculations in functions that rely on the `query` function.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Transaction Failures**: Any transaction that calls the `withdraw` function with a non-zero `shares` value when `reserve.shares[idx]` is zero will revert due to the underflow error, preventing users from withdrawing their shares.

2. **Denial of Service**: Critical operations like fee collection and withdrawals may fail if they involve tokens with zero shares in the reserve.

3. **Permanent Fund Loss**: If users are unable to withdraw their shares due to this issue, they may be forced to use other, less optimal paths, potentially leading to financial losses.

4. **Protocol Instability**: The inconsistent state between shares and balances can lead to unexpected behavior in the protocol, potentially affecting other operations.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur when `reserve.shares[idx]` is zero and `shares` is non-zero
- It directly affects core protocol functionality (withdrawals from the reserve)
- It can lead to transaction failures and potential fund loss
- It has no workaround once the condition is met

## Proof of Concept
Consider the following scenario:

1. A user has some shares in the reserve for a specific token (vertex).
2. Due to some operation (e.g., a withdrawal or a transfer), `reserve.shares[idx]` becomes 0.
3. The user attempts to withdraw their remaining shares by calling a function that internally calls `ReserveLib.withdraw`.
4. The `withdraw` function checks if `reserve.shares[idx]` is zero, and since it is, it returns 0.
5. However, the function then attempts to subtract `shares` from `reserve.shares[idx]`, which causes an underflow error since `reserve.shares[idx]` is 0 and `shares` is non-zero.
6. The transaction reverts, and the user is unable to withdraw their shares.

This scenario is not theoretical - it's a realistic sequence of operations that could occur in the protocol, especially if there are rounding errors or if the reserve shares are depleted through other means.

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of bounds checking on the `shares` parameter. The function assumes that `shares <= reserve.shares[idx]` holds true, but this invariant is not enforced, leading to unsafe arithmetic.

While the function includes an early return to avoid division by zero when `reserve.shares[idx]` is zero, it fails to validate that `shares` is not greater than `reserve.shares[idx]` in the general case, which can lead to an underflow error when attempting to subtract `shares` from `reserve.shares[idx]`.

## Code Snippet
From `src/multi/vertex/Reserve.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Reserve.sol#L63-L79:

```solidity
/// Withdraw the redemption value of the given shares to this contract from the vault.
/// @dev We round down the redeemed value for safety reasons.
function withdraw(
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 shares
) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    Reserve storage reserve = Store.reserve();
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
    uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
    amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
    vProxy.withdraw(RESERVEID, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
    reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several approaches to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Add a Check for Non-Zero Shares**: Modify the `withdraw` function to check if `shares` is non-zero before subtracting it from `reserve.shares[idx]`:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 shares
) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    Reserve storage reserve = Store.reserve();
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
    uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
    amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
    vProxy.withdraw(RESERVEID, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
    // Only subtract shares if they're non-zero
    if (shares > 0) {
        reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;
    }
}
```

2. **Add a Check for Shares <= Reserve Shares**: Modify the `withdraw` function to explicitly enforce the invariant that `shares` must not be greater than `reserve.shares[idx]`:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 shares
) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    Reserve storage reserve = Store.reserve();
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
    // Enforce the invariant with a clear error message
    require(shares <= reserve.shares[idx], "Insufficient reserve shares");
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
    uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
    amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
    vProxy.withdraw(RESERVEID, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
    reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;
}
```

3. **Return Early if Shares is Zero**: Modify the `withdraw` function to return early if `shares` is zero:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    VertexId vid,
    uint256 shares
) internal returns (uint256 amount) {
    if (shares == 0) return 0;
    Reserve storage reserve = Store.reserve();
    uint8 idx = vid.idx();
    if (reserve.shares[idx] == 0) return 0;
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
    uint128 balance = vProxy.balance(RESERVEID, true);
    amount = (shares * balance) / reserve.shares[idx];
    vProxy.withdraw(RESERVEID, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
    reserve.shares[idx] -= shares;
}
```

Option 2 is the most comprehensive solution, as it explicitly enforces the invariant that `shares <= reserve.shares[idx]`. By failing early with a clear error message, it improves debugging and catches potential issues during integration, while preventing the underflow error.
