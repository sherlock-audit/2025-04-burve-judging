# Double taxation on withdrawal due to miscalculated `removedAmount` in `removeValueSingle()`

### Summary

__Note__: 
This vulnerability becomes emergent after fixing an existing `zero-taxation issue` as I have described in [this report](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve-Tigerfrake/issues/2). Kindly check that one out first before handling this.
----

The `removeValueSingle()` function inside the `Closure` incorrectly calculates the value removed from a user's balance. It first subtracts the fair balance to determine the amount to be removed, then adds an additional adjustment value (net of tax), which causes the tax to be effectively deducted twice. This results in the user receiving less than expected during withdrawal.


### Root Cause

The [`Closure.removeValueSingle()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L285-L288) function computes `removedAmount` as:
```solidity
        uint256 untaxedRemove = fairVBalance - finalAmount;
        self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);
        tax = FullMath.mulX128(untaxedRemove, self.baseFeeX128, true);
        // @audit-issue  tax deducted here then returned
>>      removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax;
```
However, the second term (`untaxedRemove - tax`) is derived from a subtraction already accounted for in the first line. This means that taxable portion has already been removed from the returned value.

Now, As I have shown in the above stated report, the correct method to be used in tax calculation is as follows in the external wrapper function, [`ValueFacet.removeValueSingle()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L228-L243):
```diff
        // removedNominal is returned here
        (uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(
            value,
            bgtValue,
            vid
        );
        // converted to real
        uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
        Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
        // tax calculated 
        uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
-           removedBalance,
+           realRemoved,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );
        c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
        // @audit-issue Tax is again deducted
>>      removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;
        require(removedBalance >= minReceive, PastSlippageBounds());
        // @audit-issue Users receive less value
>>      TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, removedBalance);
```
However, as seen , the `removedNominal` value returned from the inner function is again used to compute a `realTax`, which is then subtracted from the final transfer amount. As a result, tax is deducted both internally and externally.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Closure contains unlocked vertices (`!isAnyLocked(self)`).
2. The balance in the specified vertex is sufficient to cover value.


### External Pre-conditions

1. User calls `removeValueSingle()` with non-zero value and `bgtValue <= value`.
2. The caller's balance in the `Vertex` is sufficient to withdraw the requested `value`.


### Attack Path

1. A user invokes `removeValueSingle()` to withdraw tokens.
2. The internal `Closure.removeValueSingle()` calculates the `removedAmount` with a tax already deducted.
3. The external function converts this to a real value and again deducts a proportional tax from it.
4. As a result, the user receives less than they should â€” an effective double taxation.


### Impact

`tax` is first deducted internally within the `Closure` contract and then again externally before the final transfer, causing users to receive less than the amount they are entitled to.


###  Poc
// (1) First, modify  `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle()` as shown above
// (2) Add the following test in `test/facets/ValueFacet.t.sol`:
```solidity
    // Add this import among other imports in the file
    import {console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

    function testDoubleTaxationInRemoveValueSingle() public {
        uint256 oneX128 = 1 << 128;
        vm.prank(owner);
        // owner sets closure fee. This is to be deducted upon value addition and removal
        simplexFacet.setClosureFees(0xD, uint128(oneX128 / 10000), 0); // 0.01%

        uint128 valueAdded = 13e13;
        uint128 valueRemoved = 13e13;
        
        // performs addValueSingle()
        uint256 tokensSent = valueFacet.addValueSingle(
            address(this),
            0xD,
            valueAdded,
            12e12,
            tokens[2],
            0
        );
        // Here, a value worth 13e13 amount is added. Given a 0.01% tax, the user supplies 130008677776869 
        console.log("Amount of tokens sent:", tokensSent); // 130008677776869
        
        // assert that fee deducted is 0.01%
        assertApproxEqRel(tokensSent, valueAdded, 1e14, "tkvvs");

        // Let's remove this value.
        // When fees exist, we expect a positive deduction(realTax) 
        uint256 tokensReceived = valueFacet.removeValueSingle(
            address(this),
            0xD,
            valueRemoved,
            12e12,                                                                                                                                                           
            tokens[2],
            0
        );
        // Now we've got 13e13 to be removed and again, we're taking a 0.01% tax which means the user should get value less by that %
        // However, deduction will be done twice thereby yielding much less value ~0.02%
        console.log("Amount of tokens received:", tokensReceived);

        // assert that fee is actually deducted twice and such is ~0.02%
        assertApproxEqRel(tokensReceived, valueRemoved, 2e14, "tkvvs");
    }
```
// (3) Run: `forge test --mt testDoubleTaxationInRemoveValueSingle -vvvv`


### Mitigation

Modify the return value from `Closure` as folows:
```diff
        uint256 untaxedRemove = fairVBalance - finalAmount;
        self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);
        tax = FullMath.mulX128(untaxedRemove, self.baseFeeX128, true);
-       removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax;
+       removedAmount += untaxedRemove;
```
