# Protocol does not handle stETH transfer edge case where 1~2 wei is deducted

## Summary
Protocol claims to support rebasing tokens but doesn't account for the `stETH` 1-2 wei edge case during token transfers.

## Description 
In multiple places throughout the codebase, the protocol transfers assets with the assumption that the amount specified in the transfer is equal to the amount received. However, stETH has a documented [1-2 wei edge case](https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case) in which the amount received during a transfer may be slightly less (by 1-2 wei) than the amount specified.

[Example](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L87-L92) in `ValueFacet`:
```solidity
// addValue
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
            if (!cid.contains(i)) continue; // Irrelevant token.
            address token = tokenReg.tokens[i];
            uint256 realNeeded = AdjustorLib.toReal(
                token,
                requiredNominal[i],
                true
            );
            requiredBalances[i] = realNeeded;
@>            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
                token,
                msg.sender,
                address(this),
@>                realNeeded
            );
@>            Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).deposit(cid, realNeeded);
        }
```


While this discrepancy is small for individual transactions, it can accumulate over time and lead to accounting issues, especially in a protocol that relies on precise token accounting.

The affected contract functions include:
`ValueFacet.sol`
`SwapFacet.sol`
`SimplexFacet.sol:`
`Burve.sol:`

## Impact
- Over time, the protocol may track slightly more assets than it actually holds due to accumulated 1-2 wei discrepancies per transfer
- The protocol's internal accounting will become gradually more inaccurate

## Recommendation
Protocol should check the contract's balance before and after token transfers and use the actual amount received/sent for accounting purposes:

i.e: 
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = token.balanceOf(address(this));
TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(token, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 balanceAfter = token.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualAmountReceived = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
