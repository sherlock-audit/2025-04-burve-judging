# In Burve::mint(), whith a KodiakIsland, the first mint will always lock Island shares forever

# Burve::mint() with KodiakIsland, first mint will lock Island shares forever

### Summary

On [`Burve::mint()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226-L290), the first mint is callable by anyone (and probably the pool creator) and the recipient of the shares is the pool itself to protect from vault inflation attack. [On first mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L273), `recipient = pool`, otherwise the call revert.

But in pool linked to a KodiakIsland, it will mint shares of the KodiakIsland to the pool itself. Those shares will be lost forever.


### Root Cause

The mint function always call `mintIsland()` even for the first call. The first call is supposed to protect from inflation attack. As the KodiakIsland is already deployed and initialized by Kodiak team, it's not necessary to mint and lock island shares on the first call.

```solidity
    function mint(
        address recipient,
        uint128 mintNominalLiq,
        uint160 lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint160 upperSqrtPriceLimitX96
    )
        public
        withinSqrtPX96Limits(lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96, upperSqrtPriceLimitX96)
        returns (uint256 shares)
    { 
    //...
    if (range.isIsland()) {
        islandShares = mintIsland(recipient, liqInRange); //@audit on first mint, recipient = pool. Those shares are lost forever
    } else {
    //...
    }
```

There is no way to retrieve island share that belong to the pool itself.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Deploy a pool with KodiakIsland

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Call `mint( address(pool), MIN_DEAD_SHARES + 1, ..)` to do a deposit and `burn` shares 

### Impact

All pool with an associated KodiakIsland will lock Island shares forever on the first deposit.

### PoC

1. Deploy a Pool with KodiakIsland
2. Call mint
3. IslandShare minted to the pool are locked forever

### Mitigation

Do not call `mintIsland()` when `totalShares = 0`

```diff
    function mint(
        address recipient,
        uint128 mintNominalLiq,
        uint160 lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96,
        uint160 upperSqrtPriceLimitX96
    )
        public
        withinSqrtPX96Limits(lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96, upperSqrtPriceLimitX96)
        returns (uint256 shares)
    { 
    //...
-   if (range.isIsland()) {
+   if (range.isIsland() && totalShares != 0) {
        islandShares = mintIsland(recipient, liqInRange); //@audit on first mint island share will be lost, and why it is forced
    } else {
    //...
    }
```
