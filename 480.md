# Closure : `_trimBalance` function will revert when `nonBgtValueStaked` is zero.

### Summary

The function `_trimBalance` in closure implementation is called for following cases.
Update the bgt earnings for a single token using the current staking balances.
Update the bgt earnings with the current staking balances.Called before any value changes, swaps, or fee collections.

There is an issue when all the staked values are directed to earn the bgt. in this case the closure does not have any bgt token.

when we look at the `_trimBalance`, it takes the `nonBgtValueStaked` which is nothing but, `self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked`. When both these values are equal, the result would be zero.

but the function `_trimBalance` uses it in the division operation. revert will happen at line 742.

### Root Cause

This can happen when all the stakes values are directed to earn the bgt.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Nothing

### External Pre-conditions

No

### Attack Path

This comes by the nature of clousre implementation and how the parameters are configured.

### Impact

All the functions that depend on `trimBalance`, `trimBalances` will revert inside the Closure library.
Below are the few of the functions that we listed.
swapInExact
swapOutExact
addValue
addValueSingle

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
    function trimAllBalances(Closure storage self) internal {
        uint256 nonBgtValueStaked = self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked;
        for (
            VertexId vIter = VertexLib.minId();
            !vIter.isStop();
            vIter = vIter.inc()
        ) {
            if (self.cid.contains(vIter))
                _trimBalance(self, vIter, nonBgtValueStaked);
        }
    }

    /// Update the bgt earnings for a single token using the current staking balances.
    function trimBalance(Closure storage self, VertexId vid) internal {
        uint256 nonBgtValueStaked = self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked;
        _trimBalance(self, vid, nonBgtValueStaked);
    }
```

In above functions, do not call the `_trimBalance` when the `nonBgtValueStaked` is zero.
