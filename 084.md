# Vulnerability Report: Missing Bounds Check in getToken Function

### Summary

The absence of bounds checking in the getToken function allows for out-of-bounds access, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors for the protocol as an attacker can provide an invalid index to access uninitialized or unintended memory slots.​

### Root Cause

In [Token.sol:68](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Token.sol#L68), the getToken function lacks validation to ensure that the provided index is within the bounds of the tokens array. This omission can result in out-of-bounds access.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The tokens array is initialized with a fixed size, typically defined by MAX_TOKENS.
2. An attacker or user can call the getToken function with an index equal to or greater than MAX_TOKENS.

### External Pre-conditions

No specific external conditions are required; the vulnerability is inherent to the contract's internal logic.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker calls the getToken function with an index value equal to or exceeding the length of the tokens array.
2. Due to the lack of bounds checking, the function attempts to access an index outside the array's range.
3. This can lead to unexpected behavior, including returning default values or causing the contract to revert, depending on the Solidity version and compiler settings.

### Impact

The protocol may experience unexpected behavior or errors, potentially leading to denial of service or incorrect data being returned. While this may not directly result in loss of funds, it undermines the contract's reliability and could be exploited to disrupt normal operations.

### PoC

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TokenTest {
    address[MAX_TOKENS] public tokens;

    function getToken(uint8 idx) public view returns (address) {
        return tokens[idx];
    }
}
```

Calling getToken(MAX_TOKENS) would attempt to access an index outside the bounds of the tokens array, leading to unexpected behavior.​

### Mitigation

Implement bounds checking within the getToken function to ensure the provided index is within the valid range:​
```solidity
function getToken(uint8 idx) public view returns (address) {
    require(idx < tokens.length, "Index out of bounds");
    return tokens[idx];
}
```
This check prevents out-of-bounds access by ensuring the index is within the valid range of the tokens array.​
