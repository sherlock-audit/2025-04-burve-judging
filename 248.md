# Incorrect Order of Operations in Island Share Burning Leading to Failed Transactions and Locked Funds

### Summary

A critical flaw exists in the burnIsland function of the Burve protocol, where LP tokens are withdrawn from the StationProxy to the user before burning the associated island shares. This causes the subsequent island.burn call to fail, as the Burve contract no longer holds the tokens. The result is failed transactions and permanently locked funds for users attempting to burn their Burve LP tokens when island shares are involved.

### Root Cause

The burnIsland function executes operations in an incorrect sequence:

Withdraws island LP tokens from the StationProxy to the user (msg.sender).

Attempts to burn the withdrawn tokens from the Burve contract (address(this)), which no longer holds them.

This violates the ERC20 standard, as burning tokens requires the contract to hold them. The correct sequence would be to burn first (using the StationProxy’s custody) and withdraw residual tokens afterward.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The Burve protocol has integrated an IKodiakIsland instance for liquidity management.
Users have deposited island LP tokens into the StationProxy via mintIsland.
The burnIsland function is triggered when users attempt to burn their Burve LP tokens that correspond to island shares.

### External Pre-conditions

A user calls the burn function to redeem their Burve LP tokens.
The user’s Burve LP balance includes shares linked to island LP tokens held in the StationProxy.



### Attack Path

User Action: A legitimate user calls burn to redeem their Burve LP tokens.
Flawed Flow:
burnIsland withdraws island LP tokens from the StationProxy to the user’s wallet (msg.sender).
The contract then calls island.burn(islandBurnShares, address(this)), attempting to burn tokens from its own address.
Failure: The burn operation reverts because address(this) (Burve contract) does not hold the island LP tokens after withdrawal. The transaction fails, leaving the user unable to redeem their tokens.

### Impact

Funds Locked: Users cannot burn their Burve LP tokens, rendering their assets irretrievable.
Protocol Trust: Repeated transaction failures erode user confidence.
Financial Loss: Users lose access to their deposited liquidity indefinitely.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refactor and do burn first then withdraw
