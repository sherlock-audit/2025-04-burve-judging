# Double Tax Deduction and Vault Under-withdrawal in Closure.removeValueSingle

### Summary

The `Closure.removeValueSingle` function mistakenly subtracts the tax from the withdrawal amount, even though the tax is also correctly subtracted **later** before transferring funds to the user. This leads to **double tax deduction** and a **withdrawal from the vault that is lower than expected**, causing discrepancies in internal accounting, unexpected user balances, and potential downstream issues with slippage and liquidity.



### Root Cause

The following line in the internal function is incorrect:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L288

The subtraction of `tax` here is **premature and incorrect**, because tax is already handled in the external function just before the final transfer:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L241

By deducting the tax both during internal accounting and again before transfer, the contract ends up **removing less than it should from the vault** and **paying the user even less than they are entitled to**.


Assume the following:

if untaxedRemove is **1,000 tokens**
The calculated tax is **100 tokens**
So the user should receive: **900 tokens**
1,000 tokens should be withdrawn from the vault **(900 to the user, 100 as tax)**


Internal function:
`removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax` → `removedAmount = 900`

External function:
`vertex.withdaw` withdraws 900(in real)
realTax = 900 * ratio → realTax ≈ 90
removedBalance = 900 - 90 = 810

❌ User only gets 810
❌ Vault only loses 900
❌ Tax is recorded twice (90 real, 100 nominal)

### Attack Path

### Impact

1. Double deduction of tax: Users are unfairly penalized and lose funds.
2. Vault under-withdraws: The protocol withdraw **less than intended** from vault, leading to incorrect accounting.
3. Slippage protection failures: `require(removedBalance >= minReceive)` may revert unnecessarily.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the internal function to avoid subtracting tax prematurely:

```diff
- removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax;
+ removedAmount += untaxedRemove;
```
This ensures:
- The vault removes the full pre-tax amount (user share + tax).
- Tax is only deducted once before the transfer to the recipient.
