# Front‑Running & Sandwich Attack Risk Due to Insufficient Slippage Controls in SwapFacet

### Summary

The swap function in the `SwapFacet` only enforces a single-sided `amountLimit` check on the final input/output amount, without considering dynamic price impact or on‑chain state changes during execution. This allows MEV bots and front‑runners to observe pending swaps, insert orders before and after them (sandwich attacks), and extract value, especially on small trades where price tolerances are lax.

### Root Cause

Single‑Sided Slippage Check: The implementation validates only that `outAmount ≥ amountLimit` (for exact‑in swaps) or `inAmount ≤ amountLimit` (for exact‑out), without verifying that the effective price falls within a user‑acceptable range relative to the spot price at transaction submission.

Lack of Pre‑ and Post‑Price Bounds: No checks on the pool’s `sqrtPriceX96` before and after swap execution to enforce maximum price movement or price impact limits.

       function swap(
           address recipient, address inToken, address outToken,
           int256 amountSpecified, uint256 amountLimit, uint16 _cid
       ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount) {
           ...
           if (amountSpecified > 0) {
               // exact-in path
               ...
               require(outAmount >= amountLimit,
                   SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, outAmount, true));
           } else {
               // exact-out path
               ...
               if (amountLimit != 0) {
                   require(inAmount <= amountLimit,
                        SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, inAmount, false));
               }
           }
           ...
       }
The lack of pre‑swap spot price check and post‑swap price‑impact constraint enables sandwich attacks. Implementing bidirectional price‐limit enforcement around the actual on‑chain price will mitigate this vulnerability.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user calls `SwapFacet.swap(recipient, inToken, outToken, amountSpecified, amountLimit, cid)`.

2. The function calculates `nominalIn` or `nominalOut` and performs the on‑chain swap logic through `Closure.swapInExact` or `swapOutExact`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A publicly visible pending transaction with swap parameters is present in the mempool.

2. MEV bots can observe the transaction before it is mined.

### Attack Path

1. Victim Submission: Alice submits a swap of 1 ETH for USDC, expecting at least 2,000 USDC (`amountLimit = 2000`). She accepts significant slippage due to volatile markets.

2. MEV Bot Front‑Run: Bot detects Alice’s pending swap. It submits a front order to buy USDC with ETH, pushing price against Alice’s trade.

3. Alice’s Swap Executes: Alice’s transaction now receives fewer USDC for the same ETH (`outAmount < expectedMarket` but ≥ 2000, so the single‐sided check passes).

4. MEV Bot Back‑Run: Bot executes a back order selling USDC for ETH, profiting from the price movement it induced.

### Impact

MEV bots reliably extract value from honest users on each swap.

### PoC

       // Snapshot: pool spot price = 2000 USDC/ETH

       // Alice’s tx (pays 1 ETH, expects ≥ 2000 USDC)
       swap(..., amountSpecified=1 ETH, amountLimit=2000 USDC, ...)

       // MEV Bot front-runs:
       swap(botRecipient, USDC→ETH, small amount) 
       // pushes price to 2020 USDC/ETH

      // Alice executes, gets ~1980 USDC (still ≥ 2000? assume amountLimit was 1950)
       // passes amountLimit check

       // MEV Bot back-runs:
        swap(botRecipient, ETH→USDC, reverse amount)
        // captures profit from 2020→2000 price reversion

### Mitigation

Two‑Sided Slippage Checks and also Pre‑ and Post‑Price Bounds
