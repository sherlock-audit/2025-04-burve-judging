# swapOutExact will accrue phantom balance in the "inToken" when swapping

### Summary

When swapping, the user can specify a negative amount to allow the protocol to perform an exact swap of the outToken. However, when calculating the required inToken amount, the protocol sets the new balance of the inToken in the closure to the untaxed amount. As a result, when the tax is later subtracted from the inToken amount in the facet, it creates an inconsistent balance in the closure.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L438-L494

On line 487 the protocol sets the balance to the untaxed amount which is wrong, as the tax go to the earnings and it doesn't add to the value of the closure.



### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

1. User needs to execute swap with negative amount in order to trigger the swapOutExact()

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Inflating the amount of the "inToken" even though there is no such balance in the closure will result in future swaps that do not correspond to the actual value of the closure. This will create major inconsistencies in the protocol value maths.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When setting the balance subtract the tax
```solidity
 inAmount = UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp(
            untaxedInAmount << 128,
            ONEX128 - self.baseFeeX128
        );
        tax = inAmount - untaxedInAmount;
self.setBalance(inIdx, newInBalance - tax);
```
