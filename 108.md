# Incorrect `realTax` Calculation Prevents Fee Collection for Protocol/LPs in `removeValueSingle`

## Summary

Using the uninitialized return variable `removedBalance` instead of `realRemoved` in the `realTax` calculation within `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle` will cause a loss of fee revenue for the Protocol/LPs, as any user calling `removeValueSingle` will inadvertently bypass the fee collection mechanism.

## Root Cause

In `ValueFacet.sol:237` the `realTax` calculation incorrectly uses the uninitialized return variable `removedBalance` (which defaults to 0) as the first argument to `FullMath.mulDiv`. The correct base for the proportional calculation should be `realRemoved` (the gross real amount withdrawn before tax). This mistake results in `realTax` always being calculated as zero.

```solidity
// File: Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol, lines 234-238
uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
    removedBalance, // <<< BUG: Uses 0 instead of realRemoved
    nominalTax,
    removedNominal
);
```

## Attack Path

1.  A user calls `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle` specifying a `value` to withdraw via a single `token`, along with a valid `recipient`, `_closureId`, `bgtValue`, and `minReceive`.
2.  The function successfully calls `Store.assets().remove`, which internally calls `collect` to credit pending earnings (correctly) and then reduces the user's stake record.
3.  The function calls `c.removeValueSingle` (in `Closure.sol`), which calculates and returns the net `removedNominal` amount and the `nominalTax` that *should* be applied.
4.  `realRemoved` is calculated correctly based on `removedNominal`.
5.  `realTax` is calculated incorrectly at line 237 using `FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance=0, nominalTax, removedNominal)`, resulting in `realTax = 0`.
6.  `c.addEarnings` is called with `vid` and `realTax=0`. No earnings are added to the pool's checkpoints.
7.  The final `removedBalance` assigned to the return variable (line 240) becomes `realRemoved - realTax` -> `realRemoved - 0` -> `realRemoved`.
8.  The `require(removedBalance >= minReceive, PastSlippageBounds())` check passes if `realRemoved` meets the `minReceive` threshold.
9.  `TransferHelper.safeTransfer` sends the full `realRemoved` amount (gross amount before intended tax) to the `recipient`.

## Impact

The Protocol/LPs suffer a loss of the intended fee (`realTax`) on every successful `removeValueSingle` call. The user withdrawing benefits by receiving the gross withdrawal amount (`realRemoved`) instead of the net amount after fees (`realRemoved - realTax`).
