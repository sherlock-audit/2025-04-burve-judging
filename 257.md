# One-sided rounding steals liquidity over time

### Summary

Because [addValue()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L111-L144) and `addValueSingle()` round up any fractional token amounts, while `removeValue()` and `removeValueSingle()` round down, each deposit over-credits the closure’s nominal balances by up to 1 unit per token and each withdrawal under-credits. Over many small add/remove operations, the recorded balances drift ahead of the real balances, eventually causing the last LP’s redemption to fail.

### Root Cause

- Add side uses `FullMath.mulX128(..., true)` (round up) to compute required token increments.
- Remove side uses `FullMath.mulX128(..., false)` (round down) to compute withdrawals.
- No mechanism tracks or corrects the one-sided “round-up crumbs.”

### Internal Pre-conditions

None beyond a non-empty closure `(n ≥ 1)`.

### External Pre-conditions

A sequence of many small `addValue*` and `removeValue*` operations where each fractional part is non-zero.

### Attack Path

1. LP A adds a tiny value—balances increase by ⌈fraction⌉ units.
2. LP A removes the same tiny value later—balances decrease by ⌊fraction⌋ units.
3. Net effect per cycle: +1 “ghost” unit per token.
4. Repeat many times to accumulate a large discrepancy.
5. A final LP’s `removeValue*` then sees insufficient real balance and reverts, locking funds.

### Impact

Last LP faces DoS on their final redemption.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the same `roundUp` flag for both add and remove.
