# Unchecked Storage Slot Layout in VaultPointerImpl.getE4626 Assembly

### Summary

The `VaultPointerImpl.getE4626` function uses low‑level assembly to load a `VaultE4626` struct from a raw `bytes32 slotAddress` field, without any validation of the storage layout. If the surrounding storage struct (`VaultStorage`) changes—due to future refactoring, added fields, or reordering—the pointer will read incorrect memory, leading to malformed state reads/writes, potential fund loss, or complete contract breakage.

       function getE4626(
           VaultPointer memory self
       ) private pure returns (VaultE4626 storage proxy) {
           assembly {
               proxy.slot := mload(self)  // Unsafe raw slot assignment
           }
       }

### Root Cause

1. Unvalidated Assembly Load: The code directly assigns `proxy.slot := mload(self)` to point at an arbitrary storage slot, trusting that `slotAddress` is always correct.

2. Fragile Layout Dependency: Any change in the `VaultStorage` definition (e.g., inserting a new mapping) will shift slot positions, invalidating the stored `slotAddress` across all existing pointers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A `VaultPointer` has been initialized via `VaultLib.add`, which sets `slotAddress` to the location of a `VaultE4626` entry in `VaultStorage.e4626s[vault]`.

2. No runtime check ensures `slotAddress` remains in sync with the actual storage layout.



### External Pre-conditions

1. The developer updates or refactors `VaultStorage`—for example, adding a new mapping before `e4626s`—without updating the assembly logic.

2. Production contracts deploy with an inconsistent struct layout.

### Attack Path

1. Refactor: A seemingly innocuous addition of a new state variable in `VaultStorage` shifts the storage slot of `e4626s[vault]` from slot `N` to `N+1`.

2. Pointer Mismatch: Existing `VaultPointer.slotAddress` still points to the old slot `N`, so `getE4626` returns a struct at the wrong location.

3. Corrupted Operations: Subsequent calls to `deposit`, `withdraw`, or `commit` read and write garbage fields.

4. Loss of Funds: Real vault deposits may be recorded in unrelated storage, leading to stale state and inability to later withdraw.

5. Irreversible Breakage: Since storage pointers no longer match, users cannot recover funds nor can the contract be patched on-chain.

### Impact

1. Vault deposits become irretrievable.
2. All vault functionality breaks, locking user funds indefinitely

### PoC

// Before refactor: VaultStorage.e4626s at slot 10.
// After: insert `uint256 newField;` at top -> e4626s shifts to slot 11.

// Existing VaultPointer.slotAddress = bytes32(10)

// getE4626 assembly loads slot 10:
//    proxy.slot := 10
// Returns completely unrelated storage (newField mapping).

// deposit & withdraw calls now modify/read newField instead of real VaultE4626

### Mitigation

Refactor `VaultPointer` to store a direct `VaultE4626` storage reference rather than raw `bytes32`.

Use Solidity’s native `mapping(address => VaultE4626) e4626s;` lookup instead of computing slots manually.
