# Missing token registry validation allows invalid tokens in closure ID creation

### Summary

The missing validation for unregistered tokens in `newClosureId()` will cause incorrect closure IDs to be generated for the protocol as the contract will include unintended token bits (including the first registered token) when a typo or unregistered token address is used.

### Root Cause

n `/multi/closure/Id.sol:newClosureId()`, the function computes the closure ID by shifting based on `tokenReg.tokenIdx[tokens[i]]` without checking if the token is registered. If the token is not in the registry, `tokenIdx[tokens[i]]` defaults to `0`, and `1 << 0 = 1`, which incorrectly includes the first registered token in the closure ID.

```solidity
function newClosureId(address[] memory tokens) view returns (ClosureId) {
    uint16 cid = 0;
    TokenRegistry storage tokenReg = Store.tokenRegistry();
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokens.length; ++i) {
        uint16 idx = uint16(1 << tokenReg.tokenIdx[tokens[i]]);
        cid |= idx;
    }
    return ClosureId.wrap(cid);
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin or user passes an unregistered token address (e.g., due to a typo or outdated registry) into newClosureId()
2. The returned ClosureId is used in a call to addClosure()
3. The contract does not validate the contents of the closure ID during addClosure()

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. An admin or tool calls `newClosureId([TOKEN_A, BAD_TOKEN])`
2. BAD_TOKEN is not registered, so `tokenReg.tokenIdx[BAD_TOKEN]` returns `0`
3. Closure ID includes bit `1 << 0 = 1` â†’ includes first token erroneously
4. `addClosure()` is called using the invalid ClosureId
5. The contract interprets the closure as including a token that was never intended
6. The protocol performs accounting and transfer operations on the wrong token

### Impact

The protocol may initialize closures with incorrect or unintended token configurations, leading to:

- Incorrect asset deposits
- Misrouted token transfers
- Inability to use or unwind the closure correctly
- Silent misconfiguration that can result in critical liquidity mismatches or financial loss

The affected party is the protocol operator or admin, and ultimately the users who rely on the integrity of closures. The attacker may not gain directly, but the protocol suffers systemic misconfiguration risk.

### PoC

```solidity
function testClosureIdConflict() public {
    {
        TokenRegLib.register(address(1));
        TokenRegLib.register(address(2));
        TokenRegLib.register(address(3));
    }
    address[] memory tokens = new address[](3);
    tokens[0] = address(1);
    tokens[1] = address(2);
    tokens[2] = address(3);
    ClosureId cid123 = newClosureId(tokens);

    tokens = new address[](3);
    tokens[0] = address(2);
    tokens[1] = address(3);
    tokens[2] = address(4); // the address which is not registered
    ClosureId cid234 = newClosureId(tokens); // It should revert here or it should different with cid123

    assertFalse(cid123.isEq(cid234), "Closure id should be different for different token pairs");
}
```
