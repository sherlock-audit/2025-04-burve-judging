# Tax is not correctly computed in addValueSingle() / removeTokenForValue()

### Summary

Tax is not correctly computed in addValueSingle() / removeTokenForValue(), the actual tax amount can be much higher than expected.

### Root Cause

When user adds value to a closure by adding to a single token in the closure, the tax is charged on the other token amount in the closure.

[ClosureImpl::addValueSingle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L198-L204):
```solidity
            uint256 untaxedRequired = finalAmount - fairVBalance;
            self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);
            uint256 taxedRequired = UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp(
                untaxedRequired << 128,
                ONEX128 - self.baseFeeX128
            );
            tax = taxedRequired - untaxedRequired;
```

Assuming the closure has 2 tokens, it would need 2 `tokenA` to add 1 value, and the untaxed required amount is 1 `tokenA`, this is because the effectively "lost" is 1 `tokenB` by not adding `tokenB`. Therefore, if the tax rate is 10%, then the tax amount should be `0.1` tokenA, however, the actual tax calculation implemented in the code is as below:

$$taxedRequired = {untaxedRequired \over {1 - baseFee}}$$

This can lead to the tax being much higher than expected.

|  Rate  |  Amount  |  Expected Tax  |  Actual Tax  | Actual Rate |
|:-----------|:-------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|:---------------:|
| 10% | 100 | 10 | 11 | 11% |
| 20% | 100 | 20 | 25 | 25% |
| 30% | 100 | 30 | 42 | 42% |
| 40% | 100 | 40 | 66 | 66% |
| 50% | 100 | 50 | 100 | 100% |
| 60% | 100 | 60 | 150 | 150% |
| 70% | 100 | 70 | 230 | 230% |
| 80% | 100 | 80 | 400 | 400% |
| 90% | 100 | 90 | 900 | 900% |

The same issue exists in `removeTokenForValue()` when user removes an exact amount of one token and pay the requisite value.
