# # Earned protocol fees are forfeited during withdrawal

### Summary

## Summary
Within the `SimplexFacet.withdraw()` function, protocol fees that have been properly accounted for are ultimately not transferred to the caller. Although the system logs the correct amount and resets internal fee tracking, only the tokens currently held by the contract are sent — leaving behind the earned fees without transferring them.


### Root Cause

## Root Cause
In the implementation at `SimplexFacet.sol`, the [`withdraw()`]() function is designed to emit an event that reflects both the on-chain token balance and any fees accrued via the protocol. However, the logic fails to include the earned fees in the actual transfer — only the contract’s balance is sent to the caller.
```solidity
function withdraw(address token) external {
    AdminLib.validateOwner();

    uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));

    if (TokenRegLib.isRegistered(token)) {
        uint8 idx = TokenRegLib.getIdx(token);
        uint256 earned = SimplexLib.protocolGive(idx);
        emit FeesWithdrawn(token, balance, earned);
    }

    if (balance > 0) {
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, balance);
    }

    // Earned fees are not included in the transfer
}
```
The code tracks and clears earned fees using [`SimplexLib.protocolGive()`](), but these amounts are never actually transferred. Only the ERC20 balance of the contract is considered when executing the transfer.

### Internal Pre-conditions

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The fee amount for the token (stored in `SimplexLib.protocolEarnings[idx]`) is non-zero.
2. The token in question is recognized by the registry .

### External Pre-conditions

## External Pre-conditions
1. The contract owner initiates the `withdraw(token)` call.
2. The protocol has previously accrued earnings in the specified token.

### Attack Path

## Attack Path
1. Protocol accumulates token-based fees (e.g., via trading or other operations).
2. Admin calls the `withdraw()` function for that token resulting in earned fees being cleared.
3. The event emitted reflects both the held balance and the recorded earnings.
4. However, only the held balance is actually transferred; earned fees are not.
5. Despite the fee record being cleared, no corresponding transfer occurs — effectively discarding the fees


### Impact

## Impact
The contract owner never receives the earned fees, and they are effectively lost. This causes a permanent loss of protocol revenue that was intended to be claimable.

### PoC

## PoC
// Add the following test in `test/facets/SimplexFacet.t.sol`:
```solidity
    // Add this import to the existing ones
    import {console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";

    function testFeeLossDuringTokenWithdrawal() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);

        // simulate earned fees
        IERC20 token = IERC20(tokens[0]);
        deal(address(token), diamond, 7e18);

        uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory protocolEarnings;
        protocolEarnings[0] = 7e18;
        storeManipulatorFacet.setProtocolEarnings(protocolEarnings);
        assertEq(protocolEarnings[0], 7e18);
        uint256 initialProtocolEarnings = protocolEarnings[0];
        console.log("Initial protocol earnings:", initialProtocolEarnings);

        // record balances
        uint256 initialOwnerBalance = token.balanceOf(owner);
        console.log("Initial owner balance:", initialOwnerBalance);
        uint256 initialProtocolBalance = token.balanceOf(diamond);
        assertGe(initialProtocolBalance, 7e18);
        console.log("Initial protocol balance:", initialProtocolBalance);

        // withdraw
        vm.expectEmit(true, false, false, true);
        emit SimplexFacet.FeesWithdrawn(address(token), 7e18, 7e18);
        simplexFacet.withdraw(address(token));

        // check balances
        uint256 finalOwnerBalance = token.balanceOf(owner);
        assertEq(finalOwnerBalance, initialOwnerBalance + initialProtocolBalance);
        uint256 finalProtocolBalance = token.balanceOf(diamond);
        assertEq(finalProtocolBalance, 0);
        console.log("Final protocol balance:", finalProtocolBalance);

        // check protocol earnings
        protocolEarnings = SimplexLib.protocolEarnings();
        assertEq(protocolEarnings[0], 0);
        console.log("Final protocol earnings:", protocolEarnings[0]);

        // expected final owner balance should be initialProtocolBalance + fees
        console.log("Final owner balance:", finalOwnerBalance);
        console.log("Fee lost:", initialProtocolEarnings + initialProtocolBalance - finalOwnerBalance);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

## Mitigation
Implement a method to claim these fees during withdrawal. This can be achieved by using various methods including but not limited to adopting `Uniswap`'s `collectProtocol` function to address the issue
https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/UniswapV3Pool.sol#L848-L868

### Burve's adoption
Burve can implement a similar function by:
1. Taking a `recepient` address(`msg.sender`) and requested amount
2. Including proper access control (`onlyOwner` or similar)
3. Performing the actual token transfer
4. Including gas optimizations (like the amount-- trick)
5. Emitting events for transparency

### This would be captured as below
```solidity
function collectProtocolFees(
    address recipient,//msg.sender
    uint8 idx,
    uint256 amountRequested
) external onlyOwner returns (uint256 amount) {
    Simplex storage simplex = Store.simplex();
    
    // Calculate amount to withdraw (capped by available earnings)
    amount = amountRequested > simplex.protocolEarnings[idx] ? 
             simplex.protocolEarnings[idx] : amountRequested;
    
    if (amount > 0) {
        // Gas optimization: avoid clearing storage slot completely
        if (amount == simplex.protocolEarnings[idx]) amount--;
        
        // Update accounting
        simplex.protocolEarnings[idx] -= amount;
        
        // Perform the actual transfer
        address token = TokenRegLib.getToken(idx);
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(token), recipient, amount);
        
        // Emit event
        emit ProtocolFeesCollected(msg.sender, recipient, idx, amount);
    }
    
    return amount;
}
```
