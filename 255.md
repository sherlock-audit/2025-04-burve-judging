# When the protocol is deposited, the maxdeposit of the external vault may cause the deposit to fail.

### Summary

In the deposit implementation of the protocol, the maxdeposit of the external vault is not considered. If maxdeposit is reached, it will be [reverted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L87) directly. In fact, the excess funds should be deposited into the backup vault.
In the VaultProxy.sol contract, funds are not deposited to the backup vault.
```solidity
    function deposit(
        VaultProxy memory self,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal {
        self.active.deposit(cid, amount);
    }
```

Suppose a situation where the maxdeposit of the active vault is 500 ether. The maxdeposit of the backup vault is also 500 ether. The user wants to deposit 1000ether. According to the current implementation, this deposit will be reverted. In fact, it is possible to successfully deposit, only 500 ethers are required on both sides.

### Root Cause

In the [VaultProxy.sol ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L178-L184)contract, there is no deposit of excess funds to the backup vault.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

1. The maxdeposit of the external vault is about to reach its upper limit.

### Attack Path

1. In normal market deposits, both the external active vault and the backup vault are almost reaching the maxdeposit upper limit of 500 ether.
2. User deposit 1000 ether will revert.

### Impact

When a user calls the deposit function, it may revert.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to check the maxdeposit of the active vault and deposit the excess funds to the backup vault.
