# Access Control Flaw in withdraw Allows Fund Drain

### Summary

The BGTExchanger contract lacks proper access control on a function that allows anyone to withdraw funds. As a result, an attacker can exploit this function to withdraw arbitrary amounts of funds.

### Root Cause

```go
/// @inheritdoc IBGTExchanger
function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 bgtAmount) external {
  uint256 _owed = getOwed(msg.sender);
  if (bgtAmount == 0) return;
  if (_owed < bgtAmount) revert InsufficientOwed();
  withdrawn[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
  TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, recipient, bgtAmount);
}
```

The withdraw function in the BGTExchanger contract allows any user to withdraw up to the amount calculated by getOwed(msg.sender), minus the amount they've already withdrawn. 

By continually changing their address, an attacker can repeatedly call this function and drain all funds from the BGTExchanger.

### Internal Pre-conditions

nothing

### External Pre-conditions

nothing

### Attack Path

Whenever new funds are added to the BGTExchanger contract, the attacker can drain all of them by repeatedly calling the withdraw function with different addresses.

### Impact

attacker can drain all funds in BGTExchanger
