# Fee Underestimation from Liquidity Thresholds in queryValueV3Ranges

### Summary

The queryValueV3Ranges function underestimates total token value by excluding fees that are too small to be converted into liquidity positions. Since Uniswap V3 positions require a minimum amount of token0 and token1 to mint at least one unit of liquidity, any accumulated fees below this threshold are ignored in the compounded fee calculations. This leads to drift between actual token balances held by the contract and the reported TVL/user balances, especially over time or in fragmented LP holdings.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L625-L641

In queryValueV3Ranges, the fees earned (fees0, fees1) are converted into liqInFees via getLiquidityForAmounts(...). If the value is too small to result in at least one unit of liquidity, liqInFees == 0, and the function silently ignores those fees in the final TVL and user balance calculation.



### Internal Pre-conditions

LP position must have earned nonzero fees0 and fees1

Earned fees must be less than the minimum required to mint 1 unit of Uniswap V3 liquidity

The user must call queryValueV3Ranges() to estimate their LP share value

### External Pre-conditions

V3 pool fee growth must increase slowly (e.g., low volume or activity)

Token price volatility must keep the optimal minting ratio fluctuating enough to break compounding attempts

### Attack Path

User stakes LP shares into the system and waits to accumulate fees

Due to slow volume or narrow tick range, fees accumulate but remain too small to be compounded

The user (or a frontend) calls queryValueV3Ranges() to estimate the value of their shares

The function ignores the small fees because they fail to mint liquidity and are not surfaced elsewhere



### Impact

The LP users suffer an approximate loss of visibility and claim to small but real fee earnings. These tokens accumulate on the contract, causing a mismatch between token.balanceOf(this) and reported values from queryValueV3Ranges. This leads to:

Understated TVL

Inaccurate user share valuation

Confusion or mistrust in analytics tools and dashboards

### PoC

function testUncountedFees() public {
        // Simulate fee growth where earned fees are too small to mint liquidity
        uint128 fees0 = 50; // Small amount
        uint128 fees1 = 30; // Small amount

        // Assuming getLiquidityForAmounts returns 0 for small inputs
        uint128 liqInFees = getLiquidityForAmounts(fees0, fees1);
        assertEq(liqInFees, 0, "Should not create liquidity");

        // Now, getAmountsForLiquidity yields 0
        (uint256 compounded0, uint256 compounded1) = getAmountsForLiquidity(liqInFees);
        assertEq(compounded0, 0);
        assertEq(compounded1, 0);
    }

    function getLiquidityForAmounts(uint128 fees0, uint128 fees1) internal pure returns (uint128) {
        // Simulate actual logic threshold
        if (fees0 < 100 && fees1 < 100) return 0;
        return 1;
    }

    function getAmountsForLiquidity(uint128 liq) internal pure returns (uint256, uint256) {
        return (liq * 10, liq * 10);
    }

### Mitigation

Track uncompounded fees separately:

Introduce a mapping or global value: pendingCompoundFees0 and pendingCompoundFees1.

Update it whenever compounding fails to convert fees into liquidity.

Expose these values in queryValueV3Ranges and queryTVL, for example:

query0 += token0.balanceOf(address(this)) - accountedToken0;
query1 += token1.balanceOf(address(this)) - accountedToken1;
Log or surface leftover amounts per tick range, so transparency is maintained.

Optionally, trigger compounding when thresholds are reached (i.e., include a compound trigger mechanism based on pendingCompoundFeesX).
