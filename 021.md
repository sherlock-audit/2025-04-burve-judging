# Price Manipulation Vulnerability in SwapFacet Due to Lack of Price Impact Protection

## Summary
The SwapFacet contract in the Burve protocol lacks proper price impact protection, allowing attackers to manipulate token prices through large swaps and potentially extract value from the protocol. While the contract implements a basic slippage check, it can be bypassed by setting `amountLimit` to zero, creating a critical vulnerability that could lead to significant fund loss for users and liquidity providers.

## Vulnerability Details
In the `swap` function of the SwapFacet contract, there is a slippage protection mechanism that checks if the input or output amount exceeds a user-specified limit. However, this check is only performed if `amountLimit` is non-zero:

```solidity
// From src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol, lines 85-89
if (amountLimit != 0) {
    require(
        outAmount >= amountLimit,
        SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, outAmount, true)
    );
}
```

And similarly for exact output swaps:

```solidity
// From src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol, lines 118-122
if (amountLimit != 0) {
    require(
        inAmount <= amountLimit,
        SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, inAmount, false)
    );
}
```

This implementation allows users to bypass slippage protection entirely by setting `amountLimit` to zero. The contract documentation even explicitly states this behavior:

```solidity
/// @param amountLimit When exact input, the minimum amount out. When exact output, the maximum amount in.
/// However, if amountLimit is zero, it is not enforced. Note that this is a real value.
```

Additionally, the contract lacks any form of price impact protection that would limit the price movement caused by a single swap. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can:

1. Execute a large swap to significantly move the price in one direction
2. Take advantage of the distorted price to extract value from the protocol
3. Execute another swap to restore the price, profiting from the price manipulation

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to several severe consequences:

1. **Direct Value Extraction**: Attackers can sandwich user transactions, extracting value from unsuspecting users by manipulating prices before and after their trades.

2. **Liquidity Provider Losses**: Liquidity providers can suffer impermanent loss beyond what would be expected in normal market conditions due to artificial price manipulation.

3. **Oracle Manipulation**: If any external protocols rely on this contract's pricing as an oracle, they could be manipulated, potentially causing cascading failures in dependent systems.

4. **Flash Loan Amplification**: The attack can be amplified using flash loans to execute large swaps without requiring significant capital, making it accessible to a wide range of attackers.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It directly leads to loss of funds for users and liquidity providers
- It affects a core function (swapping) that is central to the protocol's operation
- It can be exploited by any user with sufficient capital or access to flash loans
- The potential financial impact is significant

## Proof of Concept
Here's a step-by-step attack scenario:

1. Attacker identifies a token pair with limited liquidity in the Burve protocol
2. Attacker obtains a large amount of the input token (potentially via a flash loan)
3. Attacker executes a large swap with `amountLimit = 0` to bypass slippage protection:
   ```solidity
   swapFacet.swap(
       attacker,
       tokenA,
       tokenB,
       largeAmount,  // Exact input
       0,            // Zero amountLimit to bypass slippage protection
       closureId
   );
   ```
4. This large swap significantly moves the price of tokenB relative to tokenA
5. Attacker executes a second swap in the opposite direction, also with `amountLimit = 0`:
   ```solidity
   swapFacet.swap(
       attacker,
       tokenB,
       tokenA,
       -receivedAmount,  // Exact output (negative value)
       0,                // Zero amountLimit to bypass slippage protection
       closureId
   );
   ```
6. Due to the price impact and the lack of protection, the attacker receives more tokenA than they started with
7. If a flash loan was used, the attacker repays the loan and keeps the profit

This attack can be repeated multiple times to extract significant value from the protocol.

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is twofold:

1. **Optional Slippage Protection**: The design decision to make slippage protection optional by allowing `amountLimit = 0` removes a critical safety mechanism.

2. **Lack of Price Impact Limits**: The contract does not implement any maximum price impact limits that would prevent large swaps from significantly moving the price.

These issues together create a situation where prices can be manipulated without any protocol-level protection.

## Code Snippets
From `src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L52-#L146:

```solidity
function swap(
    address recipient,
    address inToken,
    address outToken,
    int256 amountSpecified,
    uint256 amountLimit,
    uint16 _cid
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount) {
    // ... [code omitted for brevity]
    
    if (amountSpecified > 0) {
        // ... [code omitted for brevity]
        
        if (amountLimit != 0) {
            require(
                outAmount >= amountLimit,
                SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, outAmount, true)
            );
        }
    } else {
        // ... [code omitted for brevity]
        
        if (amountLimit != 0) {
            require(
                inAmount <= amountLimit,
                SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, inAmount, false)
            );
        }
    }
    
    // ... [code omitted for brevity]
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
To address this vulnerability, implement the following changes:

1. **Enforce Mandatory Slippage Protection**:
   Remove the option to bypass slippage protection by requiring a non-zero `amountLimit`:

   ```solidity
   require(amountLimit != 0, "Slippage protection required");
   ```

2. **Implement Price Impact Limits**:
   Add a maximum price impact limit to prevent large swaps from significantly moving the price:

   ```solidity
   // Calculate price impact as a percentage
   uint256 priceImpact = calculatePriceImpact(inAmount, outAmount);
   
   // Enforce maximum price impact limit
   require(priceImpact <= MAX_PRICE_IMPACT, "Price impact too high");
   ```

3. **Add Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) Checks**:
   Implement TWAP-based price checks to detect and prevent price manipulation:

   ```solidity
   // Get TWAP price from an oracle or calculate it internally
   uint256 twapPrice = getTWAPPrice(inToken, outToken);
   
   // Ensure current price doesn't deviate too much from TWAP
   require(
       currentPrice >= twapPrice * (1 - MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION) &&
       currentPrice <= twapPrice * (1 + MAX_PRICE_DEVIATION),
       "Price deviation too high"
   );
   ```

4. **Implement Volume-Based Fees**:
   Add increasing fees for larger swaps to make price manipulation economically unfeasible:

   ```solidity
   // Calculate dynamic fee based on swap size relative to pool liquidity
   uint256 dynamicFee = calculateDynamicFee(inAmount, poolLiquidity);
   
   // Apply the fee to the swap
   uint256 feeAmount = (inAmount * dynamicFee) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
   ```

By implementing these mitigations, the protocol can significantly reduce the risk of price manipulation and protect users and liquidity providers from potential losses.
