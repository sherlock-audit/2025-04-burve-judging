# Incomplete compounding leads to depositor losses

### Summary

When compounding fees, if the token ratio is different from the liquidity required, it will cause part of the fees to remain in the contract, and new depositors can include these fees when compounding next time, causing old depositors to lose fees

### Root Cause

In [`Curve.sol:897`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve-thereksfour//blob/5ade42e1baf8357f39e3ac6c001c290f39f9d31a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L890-L899), when compounding fees, if the token ratio is different from the liquidity required, the smaller amounts of tokens will be used as the basis.
```solidity
        uint256 nominalLiq0 = amount0InUnitLiqX64 > 0
            ? (collected0 << 64) / amount0InUnitLiqX64
            : uint256(type(uint128).max);
        uint256 nominalLiq1 = amount1InUnitLiqX64 > 0
            ? (collected1 << 64) / amount1InUnitLiqX64
            : uint256(type(uint128).max);

        uint256 unsafeNominalLiq = nominalLiq0 < nominalLiq1
            ? nominalLiq0
            : nominalLiq1;
```
For example, if the fee is 1000 token0 and 1200 token1, and the liquidity requirement is 1:1, then the protocol will only use 1000 token0 and 1000 token1 to provide liquidity, and the remaining 200 token1 will not participate in compounding and will not be used to increase `totalNominalLiq`. Then the new depositor can include these 200 token1 in the next compounding, which will cause the old depositor to lose fees because these 200 token1 actually belong to the old depositor.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The Curve accumulate fees
2. Compounding will be automatic when new users deposit, and there will be tokens left over when compounding.
3. These remaining tokens will partially belong to the new depositor, but they should actually only belong to the old depositor.

### Impact

This will cause the old depositor to lose fees

### PoC

```solidity
    function test_CompoundV3Ranges_Single() public forkOnly {
        uint256 collected0 = 10e18;
        uint256 collected1 = 10e18;

        // simulate collected amounts
        deal(address(token0), address(burve), collected0);
        deal(address(token1), address(burve), collected1);

        // compounded nominal liq
        uint128 compoundedNominalLiq = burve.collectAndCalcCompoundExposed();
        assertGt(compoundedNominalLiq, 0, "compoundedNominalLiq > 0");
        // v3 compounded liq
        uint128 v3CompoundedLiq = uint128(
            shift96(compoundedNominalLiq * burve.distX96(1), true)
        );
        (int24 v3Lower, int24 v3Upper) = burve.ranges(1);
        (uint256 v3Mint0, uint256 v3Mint1) = getAmountsForLiquidity(
            v3CompoundedLiq,
            v3Lower,
            v3Upper,
            true
        );
        assertGt(v3CompoundedLiq, 0, "v3CompoundedLiq > 0");

        // check mint to v3 range
        vm.expectCall(
            address(pool),
            abi.encodeCall(
                pool.mint,
                (
                    address(burve),
                    v3Lower,
                    v3Upper,
                    v3CompoundedLiq,
                    abi.encode(address(burve))
                )
            )
        );

        burve.compoundV3RangesExposed();

        console.log(token0.balanceOf(address(burve))); // 6585676426650867270
        console.log(token1.balanceOf(address(burve))); // 5
    }
```

### Mitigation

One option is to swap the fees to match the liquidity ratio, leaving as few tokens as possible.
For example, in the example above, 100 token1 is swapped for 100 token0, resulting in 1100 token0 and 1100 token1 being used to provide liquidity when compounding.
