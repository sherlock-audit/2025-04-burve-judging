# Zero-share `cid` after `VaultFacet::hotSwap()` lets first depositor do the inflation attack on the cid-level share accounting (on MEV chain)

### Summary

Promoting a **backup vault** to **active** with `VaultFacet::hotSwap()` leads to every **cid**’s accounting shares at 0.
A front-running attacker can mint one share for a cid, and later do the inflation attack.
The inflation happens **only in the per-cid share accounting layer**—the underlying ERC-4626 vault itself keeps correct balances.

### Root Cause

* A new vault is added as backup vault. 
* [`VaultFacet::hotSwap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/VaultFacet.sol#L85) simply flips `activeVault ⇄ backupVault`.  
* In the first [`VaultE4626Impl::deposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L104) after a swap or by adding liquidity, the per-cid view has  
  `totalShares == 0` **and** `totalAssets == 0` as no shares has still been minted to the vertex.  
  Because `totalAssets == 0`, the code mints shares equal to the dust deposit (1 wei) :  
  ```solidity
  uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0 ? discountedAmount : ...;
  ```
  This single share now represents **all** assets inside the underlying vault for that **cid**.

At this moment, the inflation attack is possible through MEV.

**Inflation is not on the underlying vault**; it is on the protocol’s **cid-level share accounting**

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin adds a vault as backup
2. Admin calls `VaultFacet.hotSwap()` to promote it to active status.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Chain provides reorderable transactions (MEV) :  Avalanche, BSC  supported by Burve.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker watches mempool; once `hotSwap()` appears, he front-runs by depositing 1 wei in the new vault.  
2. `deposit()` sees `totalAssets == 0` ⇒ mints `1` share.  
3. Vault now holds the large seeded balance but only 1 share exists.  
4. Inflation attack is now possible

### Impact

The first depositor after each `hotSwap()` can do te inflation attack.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

During `hotSwap()`:  
- Mint shares in order that new vault has `totalVaultShares` > 0 meaning that `totalAssets` will be > 0
