# Missing selectors from `BaseAdminFacet` for diamond cuts

### Title
Missing selectors from BaseAdminFacet for diamond cuts

### Severity
HIGH - as the new owner will not be able to call it, and thus cannot finalize ownership transfer

### Difficulty
HIGH

### Type


### Target
src/multi/Diamond.sol

## Description
If the acceptOwnership() function’s selector is not added to the Diamond, then the new owner will not be able to call it, and thus cannot finalize ownership transfer.

## Exploit Scenario
In the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535), only functions that have been explicitly registered via diamondCut() (with their bytes4 selectors mapped to facet addresses) are callable through the diamond proxy.
So if:
```solidity
function acceptOwnership() external {
    emit IERC173.OwnershipTransferred(AdminLib.getOwner(), msg.sender);
    AdminLib.acceptOwnership();
}
```

…is missing from the function selector list when the facet is added (or was removed later), then:
	•	New owner cannot call it via the diamond address.
	•	Even though the logic exists in the facet contract, it’s not “exposed” through the diamond.
	•	The pendingOwner will remain in limbo, unable to accept.

## Recommendations
```solidity
--             bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](3);
```

```solidity
  ++          bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](4);
   ++         adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership.selector;
```
