# User will bypass vertex lock mechanism and withdraw tokens, impacting protocol safety and LPs

### Summary

Missing vertex lock checks in swap functions (`swapInExact`, `swapOutExact`) will cause a bypass of intended safety controls for the protocol and LPs as a user will call swap functions specifying a locked vertex as the token output, allowing withdrawal despite the lock.

### Root Cause

In src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L420 and src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L454 the [functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L381) `swapInExact` [and](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L438) `swapOutExact` lack checks to verify if the input vertex (`inVid`) or output vertex (`outVid`) is locked.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  Admin needs to call the vertex locking function  to set the lock status of a specific vertex (e.g., `vertexB`) within a closure to be exactly `true`.
2.  A closure exists containing the locked vertex (e.g., `vertexB`) and at least one other unlocked vertex (e.g., `vertexA`).
3.  The closure has non-zero balances for both the locked vertex (`vertexB`) and the unlocked vertex (`vertexA`).
4.  A user has a balance of the token corresponding to the unlocked vertex (`vertexA`) approved for use by the Vault.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path


1.  User calls `swapInExact` specifying an unlocked vertex (`vertexA`) as `inVid` and the locked vertex (`vertexB`) as `outVid`, providing `inAmount` of token A.
2.  *Alternatively:* User calls `swapOutExact` specifying an unlocked vertex (`vertexA`) as `inVid` and the locked vertex (`vertexB`) as `outVid`, requesting `outAmount` of token B.
3.  The function executes without checking the lock status of `vertexB`.
4.  The internal balances of the closure are updated: `balances[vertexA]` increases, `balances[vertexB]` decreases.
5.  The Vault transfers `outAmount` of token B from its holdings (corresponding to the closure's balance) to the user, effectively withdrawing tokens from the locked vertex.

### Impact

The protocol cannot rely on the vertex lock mechanism to prevent token withdrawal via swaps. LPs associated with the locked vertex potentially suffer losses if the lock was intended to mitigate an issue with that vertex, as its tokens can still be drained via swaps.
