# Owner withdraw() Drains Full Contract Balance Instead of Only Protocol Fees

### Title
Owner `withdraw()` Drains Full Contract Balance Instead of Only Protocol Fees

### Severity
Impact: High
	•	The owner can drain user funds or any ERC-20 mistakenly sent to the contract.
Likelihood: Medium
	•	Occurs whenever any non-fee tokens reside in the contract (common in donations, migrations, or mis-routed transfers).

### Difficulty


### Type


### Target
src/multi/facets/SimplexFacet.sol

## Description
The `withdraw(address token)` function in `SimplexFacet.sol` allows the contract owner to pull the entire ERC-20 balance of token from the contract:
```solidity
uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
…
TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, balance);
```
Although it emits a `FeesWithdrawn(token, balance, earned)` event—suggesting only “earned” protocol fees should be withdrawn—it actually transfers ALL tokens held by the contract. Any user-supplied tokens (e.g. deposits, donations, or leftover collateral) will be swept to the owner, not just the rightful protocol fees.

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	User A accidentally sends 1,000 USDC to the SimplexFacet contract (e.g. via a mis-typed transfer).
	2.	The owner calls withdraw(address usdc).
	3.	balance = 1,000 USDC, earned = SimplexLib.protocolGive(idx) (say 10 USDC), event logs FeesWithdrawn(usdc, 1000, 10).
	4.	The code transfers 1,000 USDC to the owner—sweeping both the 10 USDC of genuine fees and the 990 USDC of user funds.

## Recommendations
Only transfer the protocol’s actual “earned” fees, not the full balance:
```solidity
 function withdraw(address token) external {
     AdminLib.validateOwner();

-    uint256 balance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
-    if (TokenRegLib.isRegistered(token)) {
-        uint8 idx = TokenRegLib.getIdx(token);
-        uint256 earned = SimplexLib.protocolGive(idx);
-        emit FeesWithdrawn(token, balance, earned);
-    }
-    if (balance > 0) {
-        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, balance);
-    }
+    // Only pull out the genuine protocol fees
+    if (TokenRegLib.isRegistered(token)) {
+        uint8 idx = TokenRegLib.getIdx(token);
+        uint256 earned = SimplexLib.protocolGive(idx);
+        emit FeesWithdrawn(token, earned, earned);
+        if (earned > 0) {
+            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, earned);
+        }
+    } else {
+        revert("SimplexFacet: token not registered for fees");
+    }
 }
```
