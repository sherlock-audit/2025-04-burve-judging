# Burve can store incorrect weight distributions during deployment

### Summary

When `single/Burve.sol` is deployed, multiplying `_weights[i]` by `1<<96` can cut off the upper 96 bits of `_weights[i]` causing `distX96` to store only the lower 32 bits. However the sum of the weights are correctly stored. This causes incorrect weight distributions to be stored. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L199

Each number in `_weights` are `uint128` (has 128 bits). 96 bits are moved to the left before dividing by `sum`, causing the upper 96 bits of `_weights[i]` to be removed.

`sum` is correctly calculated, however `distX96` may not store the correct weights.  This causes the weight distributions to be incorrect when some `_weights[i]` are >= `1<<32`.

 


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `_weights[i]` is >= `1e32` when `single/Burve.sol` is deployed

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. `_weights[i]` is >= `1e32` when `single/Burve.sol` is deployed

### Impact

- Incorrect weight distribution.
- Cannot collect Uniswap V3 fees if `distX96[i]` is 0 ([`collectV3Fees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L963-L969))

        weights[1] = 1;

        uint256 sum = 0;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < weights.length; ++i) {
            sum += weights[i];
        }

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < weights.length; ++i) {
            distX96.push((weights[i] << 96) / sum);
        }

        for (uint i = 0; i < distX96.length; i++) {
            console.log("distX96[i]: %e", distX96[i]);
        }

        console.log("fix: %e", (uint256(weights[0]) << 96) / sum);
    }
}

```

### Command
```shell
forge test --match-path test/poc/BurveWeights.sol -vvv
```

### Output
```shell
Logs:
  distX96[i]: 0e0
  distX96[i]: 1.844674406941458432e19
  fix: 7.9228162495817593524129366015e28
```

`distX96[0]` should be > `distX96[1]` since it has larger weight. However the output shows that it is smaller (`distX96[0] = 0`).

### Mitigation

The fix is to cast `_weights[i]` to `uint256` before multiplying by `1<<96`.

```solidity
distX96.push((uint256(weights[i]) << 96) / sum);
```
