# Unvalidated External Contract Usage in Store.sol

### Summary

The lack of validation on external adjustor contract address in [Store.sol:66](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Store.sol#L66) will cause a full compromise for users and protocol as an attacker-controlled Adjustor contract can be set and abused via simplex.adjustor, without restrictions or interface enforcement.

### Root Cause

In [Store.sol:66](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Store.sol#L66), the adjustor() function simply wraps whatever address is set in Simplex.adjustor without verifying if it is a trusted or correct contract:
```solidity
function adjustor() internal view returns (IAdjustor adj) {
    return IAdjustor(load().simplex.adjustor);
}
```

- There are no interface checks, no ownership restrictions, no whitelist control.
- Malicious contracts could be used here, leading to protocol-wide compromise.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin (or attacker if they gain control) needs to set Simplex.adjustor storage variable to a malicious address.
2. No verification (such as isContract, supportsInterface, or owner checks) is implemented before usage.

### External Pre-conditions

None needed: no external oracle, price feeds, or dependency assumptions.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker sets Simplex.adjustor storage variable to a malicious contract address.
2. Any function that calls adjustor() now interacts with the attacker's malicious contract.
3. Malicious adjustor could:
   - Steal funds.
   - Return manipulated values.
   - Break functionality and brick the system.

### Impact

- Full system compromise: arbitrary external call execution.
- User funds can be drained.
- Protocol operations relying on adjustor() will behave maliciously.
- Potential complete loss of all deposits/assets, depending on how integrated adjustor functionality is.

### PoC

Imagine a fake Adjustor:

```solidity
contract MaliciousAdjustor is IAdjustor {
    function adjustSomething() external override {
        // Steal funds or corrupt logic
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(address(this).balance);
    }
}
```
Attack steps:

```solidity
Store.load().simplex.adjustor = address(new MaliciousAdjustor());
// Now adjustor() returns the malicious contract.
```
Any part of the protocol using adjustor() now behaves under attacker control.

### Mitigation

- On setting Simplex.adjustor, enforce:
  - isContract() check (to ensure it's a deployed contract).
  - supportsInterface() check (to confirm it matches IAdjustor interface).
  - Owner/admin control over who can set adjustor.
- Optionally, whitelist allowed adjustor contracts.
