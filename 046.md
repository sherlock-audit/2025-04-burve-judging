# Missing Lock Check in `addValueSingle` Allows State Modification While Closure Contains Locked Vertex

### Summary

The `addValueSingle` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L147) (lines 147-191) is responsible for increasing the value staked in a closure by adding a specific amount of a single constituent token (`vid`). This function calls `trimAllBalances` at the beginning (line 151), which iterates through all vertices and interacts with their `trimBalance` function. However, unlike functions designed for value removal (`removeValueSingle`, `removeTokenForValue`, `unstakeValue`), `addValueSingle` lacks an explicit `require(!isAnyLocked(self), ...)` check.

### Root Cause

The function `addValueSingle` does not explicitly verify that no vertex within the closure is locked before proceeding with state modifications (`targetX128`, `valueStaked`, `balances`).

### Internal Pre-conditions

This allows modifications to the closure's internal accounting (`targetX128`, `valueStaked`, `balances[vid.idx()]`) even when one or more constituent vertices are in a locked state. Locked states typically signify abnormal conditions (e.g., paused withdrawals, oracle issues). 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Call `Closure.addValueSingle`

### Impact

Modifying the closure's state based on potentially stale or inconsistent data from a locked vertex introduces inconsistency. While it doesn't seem to permit direct value extraction, it deviates from the pattern established in removal functions, which explicitly halt operations if any part of the closure is locked. This could lead to the closure's parameters being updated under potentially unsafe or unexpected conditions.
