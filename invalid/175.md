# Double State Update in unstakeValue and removeValue

### Summary

The mint function calls unstakeValue and removeValue, both of which decrement self.valueStaked and self.bgtValueStaked, resulting in a double subtraction of the same values.

### Root Cause

The logical error stems from redundant state updates in unstakeValue and removeValue. In mint, c.unstakeValue(value, bgtValue) reduces self.valueStaked and self.bgtValueStaked, and Store.assets().remove (invoking removeValue) does the same, doubling the reduction. This was not intended, as the stake should only be decremented once.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A closure (cid) exists with self.valueStaked >= value + SimplexLib.deMinimusValue() and self.bgtValueStaked >= bgtValue.
No vertices in the closure are locked (isAnyLocked(self) == false).
The user has staked assets in AssetBook for the closure.

### External Pre-conditions

The caller (msg.sender) has sufficient permissions to call mint (public function, no restrictions).
The closure is active and properly initialized (validated by Store.closure(cid)).

### Attack Path

User calls mint(value, bgtValue, _cid) to unstake.
unstakeValue subtracts value and bgtValue from self.valueStaked and self.bgtValueStaked.
removeValue attempts to subtract again, causing an underflow revert.
Transaction fails, preventing unstaking and reward claims.

### Impact

Functional Breakage: Unstaking is impossible, locking user funds in closures and preventing withdrawals or reward claims.
DoS: All unstaking attempts revert, affecting all users.
Trust: Users lose confidence in the protocol

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove Redundant Updates: Modify removeValue to avoid decrementing self.valueStaked and self.bgtValueStaked, as unstakeValue handles this.
