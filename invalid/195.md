# Slippage Vulnerability in Burve Contract Liquidity Functions

The Burve contract, a stableswap automated market maker (AMM) designed to facilitate liquidity provision to Uniswap V3 pools and an optional Kodiak Island pool, contains a critical vulnerability due to the absence of slippage protection in its `mint`, `burn`, and` mintIsland` functions. Slippage protection, typically implemented through minimum output checks (e.g., minShares, minAmount0, minAmount1), ensures users receive at least the expected number of LP shares or tokens. Without these checks, users are exposed to receiving fewer shares (mint, mintIsland) or tokens (burn) than anticipated due to fluctuations in the pool’s price (sqrtRatioX96, fetched from pool.slot0()), rounding errors, or pool state changes, even within the price bounds enforced by the withinSqrtPX96Limits modifier. This issue is particularly evident in mintIsland, where sqrtRatioX96 volatility directly reduces the number of island shares (mintShares).


Impact

Financial Loss:
mintIsland: Users receive fewer island shares reducing their claim to the island pool’s liquidity and fees. decrease the user’s pool position value and fee entitlement.

burn: Fewer tokens  lower withdrawal value, directly impacting user funds.

User Trust: Unexpected outcomes, especially in volatile markets, erode confidence in the protocol, this  discouragings liquidity provision.

Mitigation
Add minimum output checks and a deadline parameter to mint, burn, and mintIsland to enforce slippage protection and prevent stale transactions
