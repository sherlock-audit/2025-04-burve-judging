# Incorrect realTax Calculation in removeValueSingle Due to Wrong Variable Usage

### Summary

Using the uninitialized output variable `removedBalance` instead of `realRemoved` in the realTax calculation will cause an economic loss and potential denial of service (DoS) for liquidity providers and the protocol as an attacker will withdraw tokens without paying taxes or trigger reverts by manipulating closure state.

### Root Cause

The `removeValueSingle function` in the ValueFacet contract incorrectly calculates realTax using FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal). Here, removedBalance is the functionâ€™s return variable, uninitialized (default 0) at the point of calculation, and is meant to be assigned later as` realRemoved - realTax`. The correct variable, realRemoved, represents the gross token amount withdrawn from the vertex. This error results in:

realTax = 0 when removedNominal > 0, as 0 * nominalTax / removedNominal = 0.
A revert when removedNominal == 0, due to division by zero in FullMath.mulDiv.


```
  (uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(value, bgtValue, vid);
uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal); // issue: uses removedBalance
c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;
```


The intended logic is to use realRemoved to compute realTax as a fraction of the withdrawn


```
  uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```

This issue causes:

No tax deduction (realTax = 0), so users receive the full realRemoved instead of realRemoved - realTax.

No earnings credited to the closure (c.addEarnings(vid, 0)), reducing fees for liquidity providers (LPs).

Reverts when removedNominal == 0, preventing withdrawals.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Closure State: A valid closure (ClosureId cid) exists with the specified token (vid) included (cid.contains(vid)).

User Input: The caller provides:

Non-zero value (enforced by if (value == 0) revert DeMinimisDeposit()).

bgtValue <= value (enforced by require(bgtValue <= value)).

A valid token registered in TokenRegistry and part of the closure.

Asset Ownership: The caller (msg.sender) has sufficient value tokens to burn (Store.assets().remove checks this, assumed to revert if insufficient).

ClosureImpl Behavior: The c.removeValueSingle(value, bgtValue, vid) function returns:

removedNominal: The nominal (16-decimal) amount to withdraw.

nominalTax: The nominal tax amount.

Bug triggers when:

removedNominal > 0: Results in realTax = 0.

removedNominal == 0: Causes FullMath.mulDiv to revert.

### External Pre-conditions

Token Approvals: Not directly relevant, as removeValueSingle involves withdrawals (no safeTransferFrom), but the caller must have approved 

value tokens for burning (handled by Store.assets().remove).

Closure Manipulation: An attacker can influence removedNominal and nominalTax by:

Performing swaps in another facet (e.g., SwapFacet) to adjust closure balances, potentially causing c.removeValueSingle to return 

removedNominal == 0.

Triggering high nominalTax via high baseFeeX128 (set in ClosureImpl) or closure state changes

### Impact


Economic Loss:

No Tax Deduction: 

No Earnings Credited: 

Denial of Service (DoS):


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the realTax calculation to use realRemoved

```
  uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```

This ensures realTax is proportional to the withdrawn amount, reflecting the intended tax.
