# No Timelock or Penalty for Unstaking and Fee Claiming

### Summary

The  `ValueTokenFacet::mint` and `claimFees` functions allow users to unstake and claim accumulated fees (token fees and BGT rewards) immediately without a timelock or penalty. This enables users to stake briefly, claim fees proportional to their stake, and exit, diluting the reward pool for other stakers and reducing closure liquidity. The lack of restrictions incentivizes short-term staking to front-run fee distributions

### Root Cause

mint executes unstaking instantly (if isAnyLocked(self) == false) via unstakeValue and removeValue, with no delay or fee.

claimFees allows claiming collectedBalances and bgtBalance without requiring an active stake or cooldown, relying on historical a.value and a.bgtValue.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A closure (cid) exists with accumulated fees (epvX128, unepbvX128, bpvX128).
The user has staked a.value and a.bgtValue in AssetBook for the closure.
self.valueStaked >= value + SimplexLib.deMinimusValue() and no locked vertices.
Closure checkpoints are updated (e.g., via swap or collect).

### External Pre-conditions

Closure is active and has accrued fees from swaps

### Attack Path

User stakes value and bgtValue via burn, setting a.value and a.bgtValue in AssetBook.
Closure accumulates fees (e.g., via swapâ€™s realTax).
User monitors fee accumulation (e.g., via Swap events).
User calls claimFees (or wrapper) to collect fees based on a.value and a.bgtValue, transferring collectedBalances and bgtBalance.
User calls mint(value, bgtValue, _cid) to unstake, receiving withdrawnBalances (from removeValue) and minted value tokens.
User exits with fees and assets, repeating across closures.

### Impact

Liquidity Reduction

Incentive Misalignment:

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add Timelock: Implement a cooldown for claimFees or mint
