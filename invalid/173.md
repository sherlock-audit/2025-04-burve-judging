# Arithmetic Overflow in toReal for Tokens with Negative Divisor

### Summary

The  `DecimalAdjustor:: toReal` function’s multiplication (value * multiplier) for tokens with divisor <= 0 can overflow, causing a revert due to checked arithmetic. This results in a Denial of Service (DoS) for swaps, closure initialization, or simulations involving affected tokens, preventing normal operation.

### Root Cause

In the toReal function, when divisor <= 0, the function performs an unchecked multiplication (value * multiplier) without validating the result’s bounds. this reverts on overflow, halting execution.

```
   function toReal(
    address token,
    uint256 value,
    bool roundUp
) external view returns (uint256 denormalized) {
    int256 divisor = getAdjustment(token);
    if (divisor > 0) {
        uint256 div = uint256(divisor);
        denormalized = value / div;
        if (roundUp && ((value % div) > 0)) denormalized += 1;
    } else {
        uint256 multiplier = uint256(-divisor);
        return value * multiplier; // Overflow risk
    }
}
```


The else branch (divisor <= 0) multiplies value by multiplier without checking for overflow.
Example: If value = type(uint256).max and multiplier = 10^6, the result exceeds 2^256 - 1, causing a revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The token must have divisor <= 0 in getAdjustment(token), typically for tokens with fewer decimals than the protocol’s standard 

The value input to toReal must be sufficiently large to cause overflow when multiplied by multiplier (e.g., value * multiplier > 2^256 - 1).
The function must be called in a context that propagates the revert (e.g., swap, addClosure, simSwap).

### External Pre-conditions

A token with divisor <= 0 must be registered in TokenRegistry and used in a closure or swap.
A user or contract must call a function invoking toReal with a large value:
In swap: toReal is called for outAmount (exact input) or inAmount (exact output).
In addClosure: toReal is called for realNeeded.
In simSwap: toReal is called for simulation results.
For exploitation, an attacker might manipulate pool state or inputs to maximize value (e.g., large swap amounts).

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Denial of Service (DoS):
When toReal reverts due to overflow, downstream functions fail:
Swap: Reverts when calculating outAmount or inAmount, preventing swaps for the affected token.
AddClosure: Reverts when calculating realNeeded, preventing closure initialization.
SimSwap: Reverts when simulating amounts, blocking price queries.
Result: Users cannot trade or initialize closures involving tokens with divisor <= 0 and large value.
