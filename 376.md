# Improper Handling of Dead Shares Enables Initial Share Price Inflation

### Summary

The contract incorrectly handles dead share initialization during the first mint. Although a minimum amount of shares (`MIN_DEAD_SHARES`) is required and a restriction is placed on the recipient being `address(this)`, the shares are still minted to recipient. This permits an attacker to exploit the compounding logic and create a share price inflation vector at zero cost.


### Root Cause

In the first [mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L267) scenario:

```solidity
if (totalShares == 0) {
    shares = mintNominalLiq;
    if (shares < MIN_DEAD_SHARES)
        revert InsecureFirstMintAmount(shares);
    if (recipient != address(this))
        revert InsecureFirstMintRecipient(recipient);
}
```

The shares are minted directly to `recipient` including the dead shares:

```solidity
totalShares += shares;
_mint(recipient, shares); 
```

But no burn occurs after this mint. This leaves the attacker with full control over the "dead" shares that are intended to be unclaimable. Unlike proper ERC4626 patterns (where dead shares are minted and immediately burned or sent to `address(0)`), this implementation allows internal control of initial shares.

By combining this with:

* A donation to the pool (e.g., transferring `token0`/`token1` directly to the contract).
* And automatic compounding via `compoundV3Ranges()` (which increases `totalNominalLiq`),
* A burn of nearly all the initially minted shares (e.g., `MIN_DEAD_SHARES - 1`).

the attacker can significantly inflate the perceived value of a single share, similar to classical ERC4626 donation-based exploits.

This is primarily facilitated by:

```solidity
totalNominalLiq += compoundedNominalLiq;
```

where `compoundedNominalLiq` is derived from both collected yield and direct token balances, including attacker-controlled deposits.


### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. Alice deposits 1000 dollar to pool
2. Attacker frontruns the transaction, he deposits dead shares and then burn dead shares - 1 liquidity and donate 2,000 dollar to pool
3. Alice will get 0 shares due to inflated share price
4. Attacker stole Alice's money

### Impact

This attack vector may cause loss of funds for the first depositor in the way it's described in attack path. Also, share price can be inflated to very high point any depositor who deposits lower than 1 wei share price will get 0 shares as well. I totally depends on the attacker's behaviour. If attacker use 10,000 Dollar to inflate this, any future deposit lower than 10,000 Dollar will result loss of funds and attacker will steal that balance because it will be tracked as collected fee in the contract.

### Mitigation

Mint the dead shares to dead address
