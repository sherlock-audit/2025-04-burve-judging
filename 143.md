# Incorrect approval target in Burve's compoundV3Ranges unction

## Finding description 

The `compoundV3Ranges` function in the Burve contract incorrectly approves token spending to the contract itself `address(this)` instead of the Uniswap V3 pool `address(pool)`. This implementation error prevents the compounding mechanism from working properly, as the contract will not be able to transfer tokens to the pool during the minting process.

## Impact

  When the contract calls `pool.mint()`, the pool will call back to `uniswapV3MintCallback()`, which attempts to transfer tokens from the contract to the pool using `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom()`. This transfer will fail because:

- The approval was given to the wrong address (the contract itself)
- The pool has not been approved to spend the contract's tokens

## Proof of Concept

The issue becomes clear when we examine the flow of operations:

  1. In compoundV3Ranges(), the contract collects fees and calculates how much new liquidity to mint
  2. It approves itself (address(this)) to spend the tokens
  3. It calls pool.mint() to create new liquidity positions
  4. The pool calls back to the contract's uniswapV3MintCallback() function
  5. In the callback, the contract tries to transfer tokens to the pool:

When source is address(this) (the contract itself), `safeTransferFrom` attempts to transfer tokens from the contract to the pool, which requires the pool to have an allowance. Since the approval was given to the contract itself, not the pool, this transfer will fail.

## Recommended mitigation steps

Change the approval target from `address(this)` to `address(pool)` in the `compoundV3Ranges` function
