# Malicious users can `mint Island` at lesser amount due to using slot0

### Summary

`sqrtRatioX96` from uniswap v3 pool's slot0 which is the most recent data point is used in Burve.mintIsland() to get mint amounts.

slot0 is the most recent data point and is therefore extremely easy to manipulate

Malicious users can manipulate the uniswap v3 pool's `slot0.sqrtRatioX96` to mint island shares at lesser amounts.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function mintIsland(
        address recipient,
        uint128 liq
    ) internal returns (uint256 mintIslandShares) {
        (uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();//@audit-issue 

        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = getAmountsForLiquidity(
            sqrtRatioX96,
            liq,
            island.lowerTick(),
            island.upperTick(),
            true
        );
```

slot0 is the most recent data point that can be manipulated through swap and flash loan. Operations that rely in this data are susceptible to price manipulation attack.

`sqrtRatioX96` represents the square root of the price ratio between token1 and token0 in the Uniswap V3 pool, scaled by 2^96.
It is determined by the current tick of the pool, which is influenced by the liquidity and trades within the pool.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `mintIsland()` uses `sqrtRatioX96` gotten from `pool.slot0()` 
```solidity
   function mintIsland(
        address recipient,
        uint128 liq
    ) internal returns (uint256 mintIslandShares) {
        (uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();//@audit-issue 
```



### External Pre-conditions

1. large swaps / flashloans 

### Attack Path

1. An attacker executes a large trade in the pool to shift the price significantly.
For example, swapping a large amount of token0 for token1 (or vice versa) could move the tick and, consequently, the sqrtRatioX96 value.

2. He then calls `Burve.mint()` and makes sure that his `lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96` and `upperSqrtPriceLimitX96` is within the sqrtRatioX96 value he was able to shift the pool to.

3. when `range.isIsland()` == true, `mintIsland()` uses his manipulated `sqrtRatioX96` gotten from pool.slot0() to `getAmountsForLiquidity()`. 

4. This way an attacker spends lesser when minting island. His minted shares are now deposited to station proxy to accrue rewards which he can withdraw later. 

### Impact

slot0 is the most recent data point that can be manipulated through swap and flash loan. Operations that rely on this data are susceptible to price manipulation attacks.

Attackers can mint island at lesser amounts by manipulating the pool's slot0 sqrtRatioX96 via large swaps / flashloans
