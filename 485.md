# Repeated calls to Closure::trimBalance could cause high precision loss

### Summary

Repeated calls to Closure::trimBalance could cause high precision loss in the calculation here ```self.bgtPerBgtValueX128 += (bgtEarned << 128) / self.bgtValueStaked;``` causing reward amounts to be significantly reduced. 

### Root Cause

In Closure.sol::trimBalance, any miniscule increase in bgtEarned is added upon: `self.bgtPerBgtValueX128` following a division. As a result, frequent instances of division (which could take place given periods of high transaction volume) will result in the reduction of rewards to legitimate users as each time a function that calls `_trimBalance` through calling `trimBalance` is called e.g. `swapInExact` or `swapOutExact`. It is not unfeasible that these types of function are expected to be called frequently.

### Attack Path

An example is explained here:
```solidity
// Initial values
bgtValueStaked = 1000e18
bgtEarned = 10e18

// First trim call - optimal scenario
bgtPerBgtValueX128 += (10e18 << 128) / 1000e18
// = (10e18 << 128) / 1000e18 
// = 3.402823669209384634633746074317682e20

// If earnings came in 10 smaller chunks instead:
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // Each trim call
    bgtPerBgtValueX128 += (1e18 << 128) / 1000e18
    // = (1e18 << 128) / 1000e18
    // = 3.402823669209384634633746074317682e19
}
// Total after 10 calls = 3.402823669209384634633746074317680e20
```

```solidity
// Single large update (optimal case)
Actual: 340282366920938463463.374607431768200000

// Multiple small updates (real case)
Result: 340282366920938463463.374607431768000000
                                       ^^^^^
// Difference: 0.000000000000200000 BGT rewards lost
```

Daily loss = ~0.0002 * 30,000 = 6 BGT reward tokens
Yearly loss = ~2,190  BGT reward tokens

### Impact

Daily loss = ~0.0002 * 30,000 = 6 BGT reward tokens
Yearly loss = ~2,190  BGT reward tokens

The true economic loss is dependent upon the true value of the token. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Only increase earnings per value and do the division in certain large increments to prevent frequent calls causing amounting earnings lost due to precision loss.
