# Users will bypass realTax calculation, causing tax loss for the protocol

### Summary

`ValueFacet.removeValueSingle()` has an incorrect tax calculation for the protocol. And users receive more than they should, avoiding tax deductions.

### Root Cause

In **ValueFacet.sol:235** the function uses **removedBalance** in the tax calculation before it is initialized. This causes **realTax** to always be **0**, which breaks the intended tax logic and leads to losses for the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user calls **removeValueSingle()** to remove tokens from a closure
2. The value argument passed to **removeValueSingle()** is greater than 0
3. The selected token has earnings subject to tax logic

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. The user calls **removeValueSingle()** with valid parameters to remove value from a closure
2. **removedBalance** is not yet assigned when **realTax** is calculated
3. As a result, **realTax** evaluates to **0**, bypassing the intended tax
4. The user receives more than they should, avoiding tax deductions

### Impact

The protocol suffers a **loss of taxes** meant to be collected during **removeValueSingle()** calls.
The user gains extra tokens equivalent to the intended tax.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix real tax calculation as below.

```solidity
- uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
+ uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```
