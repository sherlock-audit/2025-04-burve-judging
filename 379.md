# Users calling `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle`, will not get trimmed rewards

### Summary

When `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle` is called to remove a user's value for a single asset, `Asset::remove` is executed **before** `Closure::removeValueSingle`.

Inside `Closure::removeValueSingle`, the function `trimAllBalances` is invoked. This retrieves the accrued interest from the vertex and distributes it in a `rewardsPerShare` manner to both `valueStaked` and `bgtValueStaked`.

These rewards are tracked and collected via `Asset::collect`, which is invoked in the following functions:

* [`[add](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L42-L54)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L42-L54)
* [`[remove](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L107-L130)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L107-L130)
* [`[claimFees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L173-L190)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Asset.sol#L173-L190)

The issue arises because `trimAllBalances` assumes the user's value is still present when calculating rewards. Since `Asset::remove` has already been called, the value is no longer tracked, resulting in unclaimable (locked) rewards for the user.

### Root Cause

The function call order in `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle` is incorrect: `Asset::remove` is called **before** `Closure::removeValueSingle`, preventing accurate reward allocation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There are accrued earnings from the vertex that are pending distribution.

### External Pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None identified.

### Impact

Users will lose the fees (rewards) they are rightfully owed because those rewards become uncollectible after their value is removed.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

*No response provided.*

### Mitigation

Refactor `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle` to call `Closure::removeValueSingle` **before** invoking `Asset::remove`.****
