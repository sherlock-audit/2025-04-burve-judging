# {Attacker} will corrupt conversion logic and miscredit {users} using `DecimalAdjustor.sol::toNominal`

### Summary


The `DecimalAdjustor::toNominal` in[ line 42](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/DecimalAdjustor.sol#L42) fails to handle decimal scaling properly. All tests involving the toNominal and toReal functions show catastrophic mismatch between expected and returned values due to incorrect assumptions about base decimals (e.g. 1e6, 1e12, 1e18).

This can lead to:

-     Over-crediting users during deposits
-     Under-crediting them on withdrawal
-     Oracle or accounting errors in any system relying on the adjusted values



### Root Cause

In [`DecimalAdjustor.sol::[40–112](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/DecimalAdjustor.sol#L40C2-L112C6)`], the logic for adjusting between real and nominal values is **inverted** when the `adjustment` value is negative:

- In `toNominal(address,uint256,bool)` at [`line 44](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/DecimalAdjustor.sol#L42C4-L45C21)`, a **negative adjustment** is treated as a divisor, i.e. `normalized = value / divisor`.  
- But in the inverse function `toReal(address,uint256,bool)` at `l[ine 91`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/DecimalAdjustor.sol#L91C11-L91C39), that same negative adjustment is instead **converted into a multiplier**, i.e. `return value * multiplier`.

This leads to an **asymmetry**: applying `toNominal` then `toReal` with the same input does **not** round-trip to the original value. Instead, the value is **multiplied and divided inconsistently**, depending on the sign of the adjustment.

####  Example: 
If `getAdjustment(token)` returns `-1e12`:
- `toNominal(...)` divides the value by `1e12`
- But `toReal(...)` **also** multiplies by `1e12`, effectively squaring the adjustment.

This breaks mathematical correctness and protocol invariants, and creates critical mismatches between reported and actual token values.




###  Internal Pre-conditions

1. The adjustment value returned by `getAdjustment(token)` must be **a negative integer**, e.g., `-1e12`.
2. A user (any role) must call either `toNominal()` or `toReal()` with a `token` that has this negative adjustment set.
3. The input value must be **non-zero**, so that the multiplication or division causes a meaningful shift in magnitude.

These preconditions are easily satisfied if an admin or governance mechanism sets the adjustment via an external interface (e.g., `setAdjustment()`), or if the system allows arbitrary tokens with pre-set adjustments.




###  External Pre-conditions

1. **No oracle or external rate feed is used** to validate whether the adjustment factor set for a token is correct. This opens the door for **misconfigured or maliciously set adjustment values** without external validation.
2. If the token's real-world decimal precision or value scale **does not match the configured adjustment**, then incorrect conversion occurs. This could happen if:
   - A token contract is **upgraded** or **migrated** to change decimals.
   - A new token is listed **without verifying its real/nominal value alignment**.
3. External price feeds, if used elsewhere in the system, may be **inconsistent** with the outputs of `toNominal()` and `toReal()` due to misalignment, leading to **arbitrage or pricing attacks**.



### Attack Path

1. **Admin or governance role sets** an incorrect adjustment multiplier using `setAdjustment(token, multiplier)` — either accidentally due to misconfiguration or maliciously to create an arbitrage opportunity.
2. **User (e.g., Alice) calls** `toNominal(token, value, false)` or `toReal(token, value, false)` — with incorrect assumptions about how the token's real-world value is scaled.
3. Due to the **mismatched adjustment logic**, Alice's normalized or denormalized value is **drastically inflated or deflated**, potentially by several orders of magnitude.
4. **Alice deposits or withdraws tokens** from a component (e.g. EIP-4626 vault) that relies on these conversions.
5. Because the conversion is incorrect, **Alice receives more tokens than intended**, or **other users are under-compensated**, breaking the balance of the protocol.
6. If there's no check to limit adjustment values or bound the result, **Alice can repeat this** to drain value from the system or cause permanent imbalance in accounting and vault logic.


### Impact



The **users and protocol** suffer an approximate loss of **up to 1e12x in token value distortion**, depending on the misconfigured adjustment multiplier. For example, if a token has an intended multiplier of `1e6` but is incorrectly set as `1`, a user can **extract a larger share of the protocol's funds** by depositing a small amount and withdrawing a disproportionately large amount.

The **attacker gains a massive imbalance in share or token value**, effectively draining the protocol or causing **severe accounting errors** that make vaults or liquidity pools unusable.

### Mitigation

### Mitigation

To mitigate the issue:

1. **Sanitize Adjustment Values**: Ensure that adjustment values are properly validated before being set. For example, disallow values below a certain precision threshold (e.g., less than `1e6`) or above a maximum (e.g., `1e36`), depending on the expected domain.

2. **Access Control**: Restrict who can call `setAdjustment()` using strict access controls (e.g., onlyOwner, role-based access). Unauthorized adjustment can easily lead to conversion logic being broken.

3. **Input Sanity Checks**: Add runtime checks inside the conversion functions to validate that multipliers/divisors are within reasonable expected bounds.

4. **Unit Testing With Real-World Tokens**: Implement thorough fuzzing and invariant testing using real-world decimal configurations (e.g., USDC: 6 decimals, WETH: 18 decimals) to ensure conversion logic handles these scenarios safely.

5. **Precision Auditing**: Introduce assertions or logging in internal/external conversions to detect unexpected value drops or inflations due to conversion logic errors during development and testing.
