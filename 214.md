# Users can bypass withdrawal fees in underlying vault and pass the losses to remaining users

### Summary

When the underlying vaults charge deposit or withdrawal fees, the internal accounting (totalAssets, previewWithdraw, etc.) may reflect a value lower than the actual underlying balance (i.e., vault shares).

In such cases, when a user initiates a withdrawal, they receive the full requested amount even though the internal accounting only attributes a smaller value  to their shares. The `vault.withdraw()` operation succeeds by burning more underlying vault shares than originally credited to the user due to the availability of extra original vault shares in the system.

This results in the withdrawer avoiding their fair share of the fee, effectively extracting value from the system. The loss is not socialized; instead, it is absorbed entirely by the remaining users.

### Root Cause

When users withdraw their value from a Closure, the exact requested amount is forwarded to the corresponding vertex vault:

As shown in the `Closure` contract, the system assumes that all assets deposited by value providers are always available in the underlying Vertex vaults:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L216-L243](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L216-L243)

Looking at `VaultProxy.withdraw`, we can see that withdrawals are designed to be non-reverting. It attempts to withdraw the full amount from the active vault, and if there’s a backup vault configured, it assumes any shortfall will be covered from there:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L187-L203](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L187-L203)

After the withdrawal, the system calculates how many internal shares must be burned to satisfy the withdrawn amount. If sufficient shares exist, the operation succeeds.

As a result, the withdrawing user receives their full amount. However, this may leave the vaults empty. If all shares are consumed to fulfill this user’s withdrawal, **subsequent users may be unable to withdraw**, as there are no remaining assets to cover further redemptions.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None needed

### External Pre-conditions

1. Vault has withdrawal or deposit fees

### Attack Path

Happens naturally when the underlying vault has deposit or withdrawal fees or both

### Impact

Race condition on withdrawals. Some users will leave the losses to late withdrawers. In some cases, protocol fees can be stolen by users too.

### PoC


### **Textual PoC:**

Assume we start with a Closure holding two assets (A and B), totaling a value of **10 tokens**.

#### **Step 1: Initial Deposit by Closure**

* Withdrawal fees on the underlying ERC4626 vaults are 10%.
* The Closure deposits 10 tokens into the underlying vault.
* Due to the withdrawal fee, `previewRedeem` simulates that only 9 tokens can be redeemed from these 10 shares.
* The vault’s internal accounting becomes:

  * `self.shares[closure] = 9`
  * `self.totalShares = 9`
  * `self.totalVaultShares = 10`

So, while the Closure owns 10 vault shares, it only claims 9 units of value in its own internal share accounting due to the 10% fee.

#### **Step 2: Alice Deposits**

* Alice deposits another 10 tokens.
* The system again applies the same discount logic based on the vault’s withdrawal simulation.
* After Alice’s deposit:

  * `self.shares[closure] = 18`
  * `self.totalShares = 18`
  * `self.totalVaultShares = 20`

Alice's deposit gets the same discounted shares (9), assuming the vault’s PPS hasn't changed. The loss has now been socialized between Closure and Alice.

#### **Step 3: Bob Deposits**

* Bob deposits 10 more tokens.
* After Bob’s deposit:

  * `self.shares[closure] = 27`
  * `self.totalShares = 27`
  * `self.totalVaultShares = 30`

Now, the total system loss (from fees) is 3 tokens, which ideally should be socialized: 1 token each between Closure, Alice, and Bob.

#### **Step 4: Bob Withdraws**

* Bob requests to withdraw **10 tokens**.
* The number of internal shares to remove:
  `sharesToRemove = 27 * 10 / 27 = 10`
* Share accounting after removal:

  * `self.shares[closure] = 17`
  * `self.totalShares = 17`
  * `self.totalVaultShares = 30`

Now comes the critical point: `vault.withdraw(10)` uses `previewWithdraw` internally. Since the vault charges a 10% fee, to actually withdraw 10 tokens, it pulls **11.111... REAL shares** from the vault. These shares are available because the totalVaultShares (30) are still sufficient.

Bob receives **10 tokens**, having burned **11.111... shares** — but in the system’s internal accounting, Bob had only 10 shares. So he essentially bypasses the withdrawal fee.

Bob withdraws his full value **without incurring the fee**, effectively offloading the 10% penalty to remaining users (Alice and future depositors). The internal accounting allows this because the `vault.withdraw()` pulls shares using a preview-based logic, not the same discount logic used during deposit.

As a result, **fees are not fairly socialized** and **early exiters can avoid penalties**, draining value from the pool over time.



### Mitigation

Use vault.redeem instead of vault.withdraw. Al the calculations are done using previewRedeem but vault.withdraw is used which will cause the shares to be burnt to more to satisfy the actual amount withdrawn.
