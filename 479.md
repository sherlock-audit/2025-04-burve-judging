# Inconsistent vertex lock enforcement leads to potential fund blockage

### Summary

Inconsistent lock enforcement in `removeValueSingle` and related functions will cause a denial-of-service for users as the function incorrectly reverts withdrawals even when only a single vertex within a closure is locked, contradicting the intended behavior outlined in code comments and the implementation of `removeValue`.

### Root Cause

In `Closure.sol`, the [`Closure.removeValueSingle`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L252-L252) function (and `removeSingleForValue`) includes a lock check (`require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));`) that prevents withdrawals if *any* vertex within the closure is locked. This check is present within the `Closure` contract's logic, while the `removeValueSingle` function in the main contract bypasses this check when calling `Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);` using the `false` flag to disable the lock check. 

Following the logic in the `removeValue` function, where the closure does not block withdrawals regardless of a lock, the protocol's intention regarding user withdrawals during a lock is additionally documented:

```solidity
// Users can remove value even if the token is locked. It actually helps derisk us.
Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realSend, false);
```

This inconsistency means that despite the intention to allow withdrawals from unlocked vertices within a closure, `removeValueSingle` does not adhere to this design.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A user needs to have funds associated with a closure.
2.  At least one vertex within the closure needs to be locked (e.g., due to an ongoing dispute or other protocol-specific reasons).

### External Pre-conditions

* None

### Attack Path

1.  A user attempts to withdraw funds from a closure using `removeValueSingle` or `removeSingleForValue`.
2.  Even if other vertices within the closure are unlocked, the transaction will revert due to the lock check within `Closure.sol` because at least one vertex is locked.
3.  The user is unable to access their funds associated with the closure, even though the protocol's design, as evidenced by comments and the `removeValue` function, intends to allow withdrawals from unlocked vertices.

### Impact

Users are unable to withdraw their funds from a closure, even if only one vertex within the closure is locked, leading to a denial-of-service. This contradicts the intended functionality and can cause a significant inconvenience and potential loss of access to funds, which can be considered a medium severity issue per Sherlock's guidelines if it leads to funds being locked for more than a week or impacts time-sensitive functions.  The inconsistency in behavior between `removeValue` and `removeValueSingle`/`removeSingleForValue` highlights a deviation from the documented and implemented design.
