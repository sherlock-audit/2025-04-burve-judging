# Wrong input amount in Closure.sol#SimplexLib.bgtExchange()

### Summary

In `Closure.sol` before adding or removing value every token balance in a given closure is trimmed via `_trimBalance()` which calls `Vertex.sol#trimBalance()` which calculates the difference between the target and real balance of a token in a closure and returns earned shares and excess bgt (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L60).

In `Closure.sol` this excess bgt value is incorrectly exchanget for bgt if there are bgt tokens stored in the closure.

### Root Cause

In `Closure.sol#_trimBalance()` if there are bgt tokens stored in a given closure the function `SimplexLib.bgtExchange()` is called.
```solidity
 function bgtExchange(
        uint8 idx,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal returns (uint256 bgtEarned, uint256 unspent)
```

The function takes in as an argument the token ID and the **amount of that token which should be exchanged**. This can be confirmed by the test file `BGTExchanger.t.sol`. Test function - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/test/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.t.sol#L186

However when `SimplexLib.bgtExchange()` is called in `Closure.sol` the input amount is the excess bgt amount returned by `Vertex.sol#trimBalance()`.

Essentially the contract is converting bgt to bgt at a random token rate.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user should call one of the functions to trigger a call to `_trimBalances()`:
`addValue()`
`addValueSingle()`
`removeValue()`
`removeValueSingle()`
`addTokenForValue()`
`removeTokenForValue()`
`unstakeValue()`
`stakeValue()`



### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Normal user interaction with the protocol

### Impact

1. It is possible for the rate of a token to be less than 1 in which case the bgt value in the protocol will gradually decrease after every user interaction with the contract.

2. It does not seem correct to exchange bgt to bgt, this will lead to unintended behaviour. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The devs should reevaluate the usage of the function in `Closure.sol#_trimBalances()`
