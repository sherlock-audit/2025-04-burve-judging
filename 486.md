# Missing Deadline Check

### Summary

The swap function lacks a deadline parameter, allowing pending transactions to be mined later under unfavorable conditions. This enables:

MEV Sandwich Attacks: Bots exploit delayed trades by front/back-running.

Stale Price Execution: Swaps execute at outdated prices after market moves.


2. Attack Workflow
Scenario: Sandwich Attack with Delayed TX
User Submits Swap

Swap 1 ETH → USDC at current price (e.g., 1 ETH = 3000 USDC).

Transaction sits in mempool due to low gas.

MEV Bot Detection

Bot sees the pending transaction and front-runs it:

Buys ETH → pushes price to 1 ETH = 3100 USDC.

User's Swap Executes

Now executes at worse rate (1 ETH = 3100 USDC → gets less USDC).

Bot back-runs to sell ETH, profiting from the price difference.

Result

User receives 2900 USDC instead of 3000 USDC (3.3% loss).

3. Technical Analysis
Why Deadlines Matter
Blockchain Latency: Transactions can linger for minutes/hours.

Price Volatility: Crypto prices change rapidly; unprotected swaps risk massive slippage.

Current Code Risk

function swap(...) external nonReentrant {
    // No deadline check = perpetual pending risk
}
Expected Safeguard
solidity
function swap(..., uint256 deadline) external {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "TX expired");
}

### Mitigation

Solution 1: Mandatory Deadline
solidity
function swap(..., uint256 deadline) external {
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "Expired");
}
Solution 2: Frontend Defaults
UIs should auto-set deadlines (e.g., deadline = now + 20 minutes).

Solution 3: Chainlink Keepers
Automatically cancel stale transactions after a timeout.
