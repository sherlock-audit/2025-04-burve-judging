# The previewRedeem/previewDeposit function call to revert may cause the protocol to be unavailable.

### Summary

The protocol's functions of adding/removing liquidity, swapping, and claiming rewards all need to be called to the E4626.fetch function.
In the E4626.sol contract, calling the previewRedeem/previewDeposit function to revert may cause the protocol to be unavailable.

The previewRedeem/previewDeposit function may call revert for the following reasons:
1. The calculation of previewRedeem may require querying the status or price information of the underlying protocol (e.g., getting the price from Oracle, or querying the exchange rate of the underlying lending protocol). This process may revert.
2. Treasury Suspension Status.
