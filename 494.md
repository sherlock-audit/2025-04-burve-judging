# removeValueSingle() will miscalculate user payouts for token withdrawals as ValueFacet uses removedBalance before it is defined

### Summary

Using an uninitialized variable in removeValueSingle() will cause a miscalculated token payout for users as ValueFacet will compute realTax using removedBalance before it is assigned, leading to incorrect tax deduction and payout.

### Root Cause

In [ValueFacet.sol:235](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L235-L239), the function removeValueSingle() calculates:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```
before removedBalance is assigned:
```solidity
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;
```
This causes realTax to always be 0 because removedBalance is undefined (defaults to 0). The user thus receives more tokens than they should, and the protocol loses tax revenue.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user calls removeValueSingle() with a valid value, bgtValue, and token in a registered closure.
2. The closure has sufficient value and token reserves to fulfill the withdrawal.
3. Store.assets().remove() successfully deducts the correct value from the user.

### External Pre-conditions

1. No external manipulation needed.
2. Normal chain and gas conditions are sufficient.

### Attack Path

1. User calls removeValueSingle() with intent to withdraw value using a specified token.
2. Function computes realRemoved correctly, but then uses uninitialized removedBalance to compute tax:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal); // ‚Üê `removedBalance` is 0
```
3. realTax becomes 0 due to zero numerator, and full realRemoved is assigned to removedBalance.
4. User receives an overpayment, avoiding tax deduction.
5. Protocol loses value that was supposed to be retained as tax.


### Impact

The protocol suffers a systematic loss of fee revenue, proportional to the amount of value withdrawn through removeValueSingle(). Users receive more tokens than they should, potentially creating arbitrage or causing long-term value drift.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In removeValueSingle(), modify like:
```diff
- uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
+ uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```
This ensures tax is accurately computed before removedBalance is finalized.
