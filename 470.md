# Rounding Discrepancy in Tax Calculation Compromises Vertex Balance Invariant

### Summary

The `SwapFacet` contract contains a discrepancy between the code and its accompanying comment regarding tax calculation. The comment suggests that the calculation should round up to protect the vertex balance invariant, but the current implementation uses `FullMath.mulDiv`, which rounds down. 

This misalignment could potentially lead to inaccuracies in tax calculations, affecting the balance integrity. To resolve this, it is recommended to replace FullMath.mulDiv with `FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp`, ensuring the calculation aligns with the intended rounding behavior described in the comment. 



### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue lies in the mismatch between the intended behavior described in the code comment and the actual implementation. 

```solidity
            outAmount = AdjustorLib.toReal(outVid.idx(), nominalOut, false);
            // Figure out the tax in real terms. This is cheaper than another adjust call.
@>          // Round up to protect the vertex balance invariant.
@>          realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(inAmount, nominalTax, nominalIn);
            require(
                outAmount >= amountLimit,
                SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, outAmount, true)
            );
```

The comment indicates a need for rounding up to maintain the vertex balance invariant, but the code uses `FullMath.mulDiv`, which performs a floor division, effectively rounding down. The absence of using mulDivRoundingUp, which would achieve the desired rounding up, is the core reason for the inconsistency between the code and its documentation.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The use of `FullMath.mulDiv` for tax calculation, which rounds down, can lead to a systematic under-collection of taxes. This results in a financial imbalance where the contract's expected revenue from taxes is not fully realized. And the code will fail to protect the vertex balance invariant.

### PoC

### Mitigation

```diff
            outAmount = AdjustorLib.toReal(outVid.idx(), nominalOut, false);
            // Figure out the tax in real terms. This is cheaper than another adjust call.
            // Round up to protect the vertex balance invariant.
-           realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(inAmount, nominalTax, nominalIn);
+           realTax = FullMath.mulDivRoundingUp(inAmount, nominalTax, nominalIn);
            require(
                outAmount >= amountLimit,
                SlippageSurpassed(amountLimit, outAmount, true)
            );
