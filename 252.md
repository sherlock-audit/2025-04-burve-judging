# In the addValueSingle function, there is an error in the order in which taxes are assigned, which will result in a partial loss of the tax that the user gets.

### Summary

In the addValueSingle function, there are some problems with the order of calls. First, call the c.addValueSingle function to add liquidity and then call the c.addEarnings function to assign rewards.
Suppose user A adds liquidity through the addValueSingle function.
In the c.addValueSingle function, the total liquidity stake count will be recorded after calculating the liquidity added by the user. At this time, the liquidity value of user A has been included in the self.valueStaked variable.
```solidity
        // This needs to happen after any fee earnings.
        self.valueStaked += value;
        self.bgtValueStaked += bgtValue;
```

Then continue with the c.addEarnings function, and when accumulating rewards, the total is also calculated by self.valueStaked. (Same for the bgt part of the rewards.)
```solidity
        // Rest goes to non bgt value.
        self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] +=
            (reserveShares << 128) /
            (self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked);
```
The crux of the matter is that the tax paid by user A when addValueSingle should be distributed to users who already hold liquidity, and user A should not receive tax for this new liquidity.
The self.valueStaken calculated here is on the large side, so self.earningsPerValueX128 is on the small side, which hurts the earnings of all liquidity providers.
Since this is a repeatable issue. The more the addValueSingle function is called, the more damage it will cause, so it should be a high issue.

### Root Cause

In the [addValueSingle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L113-L132) function, there are some issues with the call order resulting in a partial loss of user tax.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. The user adds liquidity via the addValueSingle function. Users who have already provided liquidity lose some of their TAX gains.

### Impact

Liquidity providers lose part of their tax.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended that the addValueSingle function should settle the tax allocation before the self.valueStaken variable is updated.
