# Closures are not compatible with vaults that have fee on deposit or withdraw resulting in incorrect accounting

### Summary

According to sponsor statement the vaults with fee on deposit/withdraws might be integrated with the burve:

however closures are not compatible with this kind of vaults as their internal tracking of token balances might not be 1:1 with the balances recorded in the vaults

### Root Cause

Closures first modify their internal balances of tokens and THEN they update the vault state (i.e deposit and withdraw from them). for example, in the `Closure::addValue`, the `requiredBalances` is calculated using scaleX128, then internal balancing is updated:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L134-L143
```solidity
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
            if (!self.cid.contains(i)) continue;
            requiredBalances[i] = FullMath.mulX128(
                scaleX128,
                self.balances[i],
                true
            );
            // Update internal balancing, regardless of how many tokens we actually receive in the vaults
            self.setBalance(i, self.balances[i] + requiredBalances[i]);
        }
```
expecting the vaults to deposit this exact amount of tokens.

Samething applies to `Closure::removeValue`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L234-L242
```solidity
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
            if (!self.cid.contains(i)) continue;
            withdrawnBalances[i] = FullMath.mulX128(
                scaleX128,
                self.balances[i],
                false
            );
            self.setBalance(i, self.balances[i] - withdrawnBalances[i]);
        }
```
here, `withdrawnBalances` is calculated solely based on the multiplication of `scaleX128` in `self.balances[i]`, but this amount might be more than what the closure is keeping in the vault which might result in closure trying to withdraw more than what it has which might result in underflow error here (explained example in the code):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L146-L153
```solidity
        uint256 sharesToRemove = FullMath.mulDiv(
            self.totalShares, //total shares == 1000
            amount, //amount is 500, while closure has only 495, for a 10% fee, the other 5 tokens were charged as deposit fee
            totalAssets //this is 990 currently, the other closure holding 500 shares also deposited 500 USDT, charged with 5 USDT
        ); // Rounds down, leaves some share dust in the vault.
        self.shares[cid] -= sharesToRemove; //this tries to remove 505.050505051 shares, but closure doesnt have this amount => undreflow
        self.totalShares -= sharesToRemove;
        temp.vars[2] += amount;
```

Other parts of the system are repeating same mistake => calculating internal balance based on current parameters (efficiency factor, T and X) => updating internal balnaces => deposit/withdraw from vaults => vault might charge fees leading into inconsistency between stored balance in closure and actual balance in the vault

### Internal Pre-conditions

---

### External Pre-conditions

- Vault charge deposit/withdraw fees or introduce new fees after sometime

### Attack Path

A simple scenario of how this incorrect accounting might play out:
1- Alice deposits 500 value using `ValueFacet::addValue` function in closure 0x1, 500 USDT is deposited into vault, 10% fee => closure A has 500 shares worth 495 USDT
2- Bob deposits 500 value using `ValueFacet::addValue` function in closure 0x2, 500 USDT is deposited into vault, 10% fee => closure B has 500 shares worth 495 USDT
3- Vault has 1000 shares, 500 shares are for closure A and 500 for closure B
4- Alice requests full withdrawal of 500 values, contract tries to withdraw `(500 * 1000) / 990 ~= 505` shares from closure: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L146-L151
5- transaction fails as there are not enough assets

### Impact

This result in balance discrepancy between closures and vaults, some of the impacts are:
1- Incorrect calculation of "T" if self.balances are not reflecting the actual balance
2- Incorrect valuation of tokens, based on unsynced balances
3- Closures requesting more funds than they actually have in a vault, resulting in underflow, asset shortage etc
