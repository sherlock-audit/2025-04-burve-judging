# Default value of deMinimusX128 is always rounds down to "0"

### Summary

When the diamond is deployed the default value for the deMinimusX128 will be set to "100". However, when this value is used, it is expected to be in 2**128 precision which the value will be fetched and shifted right. Since the value is not in 128 decimals precision it will always end up "0". 

### Root Cause


When the diamond is deployed, `simplex` will be initialized [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Simplex.sol#L41-L57).

Then, as we can see, `self.deMinimusX128` is set to `100`, assuming it will work as intended:  
[Reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Value.sol#L22-L27).

However, the minimus is used as follows:

- [Line 506](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L506)

And the `Simplex.deMinimusValue()` implementation is as follows:
```solidity
function deMinimusValue() internal view returns (uint256 dM) {
    dM = uint256(Store.simplex().searchParams.deMinimusX128);
    if (uint128(dM) > 0) {
        dM = (dM >> 128) + 1;
    } else {
        dM = dM >> 128;
    }
}
```

As we can see above, `deMinimusX128` is expected to be in 128-bit fixed-point precision, such that the actual value is extracted by shifting it right by 128 bits. However, the default value (`100`) is far below `2**128`, so the result of the shift will be `0`.

We can also see another place where `deMinimusX128` is used:
[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Value.sol#L152-L159](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Value.sol#L152-L159)

This is where we look for convergence in the Newton method, but since reaching exactly "0" is practically impossible, `deMinimusValue` is used instead. It's clear that this value is intended to be something around a typical value like "100", and it definitely shouldn’t be in 128-bit fixed-point decimals. This means that updating `deMinimusValue` to solve the earlier issue could introduce a problem here. So, an inconsistency exists.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None needed

### External Pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

None needed, happens naturally

### Impact

When the `deMinimus` value returns `0`, value stakers can unstake from a closure more than they should be allowed to. The minimum value a closure must retain is enforced by the condition:

```solidity
self.valueStaked < value + SimplexLib.deMinimusValue()
```

If `deMinimusValue()` returns `0`, this condition becomes ineffective, allowing value takers to fully unstake their position. Since `self.valueStaked` will always be greater than `value` alone, the check passes, even when it shouldn’t.

setting `deMinimusValue` to a 128 bit number will create an another problem in the code where its used as stated in the root cause. Hence, medium.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

do not shift the value.
