# Invalid return type in `VaultProxy.sol::totalBalance`

### Summary

In [`VaultProxy.sol::totalBalance`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L224) 

```solidity
 function totalBalance(
        VaultProxy memory self,
        ClosureId[] storage cids,
        bool roundUp
@->    ) internal view returns (uint128 amount) {
        return
            self.active.totalBalance(cids, roundUp) +
            self.backup.totalBalance(cids, roundUp);
    } 
```

we can see that the function has a return type of uint128, and it goes ahead to find the total active balances and total backup balances of the cids provided, however we can see that it is not only one cid that is provided so this gives the balances a tendency to increase quickly, after each balance is gotten they are both added and returned.

But the case here is adding two large balances of type uint128 into a resulting type uint128 will easily overflow because no casting protections have been put in place like in the other functions.

### Root Cause

In `VaultProxy.sol:224` we can see that the function has a return type of uint128 with no casting protection when returning the final value this can lead to an overflow revert

### Internal Pre-conditions

The sum of the total active cids provided plus the sum of the total backup cids provided must be more than uint128 max

### External Pre-conditions

null

### Attack Path

Call `VaultProxy::totalBalance(cids[],roundUp)` and you'll experience the overflow

### Impact

This will lead to overflow reverts and being not able to use the function.

### PoC

textual PoC

Lets take it that 3 cids are provided.

* The sum of the 3 cids active balance = 340282366920938463463374607431768011455 
* The sum of the 3 cids backup balance = 2000000
* observe that the result of the sum of the active balances and the backup balances are greater than uint128 max
* Because there is no casting protection it will overflow leading to a revert

### Mitigation

Implement casting protection on the return value like in other functions or change return type to uint256
