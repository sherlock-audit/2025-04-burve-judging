# `ReentrancyGuardTransient` will brick all swap and liquidity actions for Avalanche C-Chain users due to missing EIP-1153 op codes

### Summary

Using `ReentrancyGuardTransient` relies on EIP-1153 op-codes `TLOAD/TSTORE`. Avalanche C-Chain mainnet has not activated Cancun/EIP-1153, so every guarded call reverts with invalid opcode. As a result, every guarded call fails, the protocol becomes unusable, and any liquidity that may already exist (e.g. from a previous version) is stuck.

### Root Cause

- In `ValueFacet.sol` and `SwapFacet.sol` the contracts inherit `ReentrancyGuardTransient` which uses the op-codes `TLOAD/TSTORE`. See the following: 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L26
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L16
- Avalanche C-Chain mainnet has not yet implemented those op-codes (see [ACP-131 ](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/discussions/139
)and [Durango release notes](https://www.avax.network/blog/durango-avalanche-warp-messaging-comes-to-the-evm) which only lists Shanghai EIPs only; Cancun/EIP-1153 is absent.)


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Deployer compiles facets that inherit `ReentrancyGuardTransient`.
2. Deployer deploys on Avalanche C-Chain.


### External Pre-conditions

Avalanche C-Chain mainnet lacks EIP-1153 (`TLOAD/TSTORE`) support.


### Attack Path

1. Deployment transaction succeeds (bytecode accepted).
2. First user calls `addValue()` → `nonReentrant` executes `TLOAD` → opcode unknown → `invalid opcode`.
3. All subsequent calls to any guarded function revert identically.
4. Protocol is permanently disabled; any pre-existing or accidentally sent tokens cannot be withdrawn.


### Impact

For new deployments, it means that users can never deposit, so TVL stays zero. If this followed an upgrade and liquidity already existed, the funds now become unreachable because all exit functions will revert (e.g., `removeValue()`, `swap()`).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider replacing `ReentrancyGuardTransient` with classic `ReentrancyGuard` when deploying on Avalanche.
