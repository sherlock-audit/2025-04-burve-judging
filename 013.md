# Owner will potentially brick core contract functionality, impacting Burve users

### Summary

Missing crucial validation checks in [migrateStationProxy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L208) will cause potential bricking of core functionality for Burve users as the Owner will call migrateStationProxy with an invalid newStationProxy address (e.g., zero address, EOA, or incompatible contract).

### Root Cause

In src/single/Burve.sol within the migrateStationProxy function, there are missing validation checks for the newStationProxy parameter, specifically including zero address checks, contract existence checks, and potentially interface compliance checks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Caller needs to be the Owner to call migrateStationProxy.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Owner calls migrateStationProxy providing an invalid address for newStationProxy (e.g., address(0), an EOA address, or an address of a contract not implementing IStationProxy or the migrate function correctly).
2. The function executes, bypassing the missing checks (zero address, contract existence, interface compliance).
3. The internal stationProxy variable is updated to the invalid address after potentially calling migrate on the old proxy (which might succeed or fail silently depending on implementation and the provided address).

### Impact

The Burve users cannot execute actions dependent on the stationProxy (e.g., minting, burning, interacting with BGT station), potentially leading to locked funds or inability to use the protocol.
