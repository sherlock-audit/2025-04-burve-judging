# Transfers between closures is causing loss of funds

### Summary & Root Cause

In multipool system, users can deposit their tokens to any closure ( subset of pool ) and they get equivalant amount of value based on the deposited amount. They can also mint their value by unstaking their tokens from the pool.

```solidity
    function mint(uint256 value, uint256 bgtValue, uint16 _cid) external {
        require(bgtValue <= value, InsufficientValueForBgt(value, bgtValue));
        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_cid);
        Closure storage c = Store.closure(cid); // Validates cid.
        c.unstakeValue(value, bgtValue);
        Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
        _mint(msg.sender, value);
    }
```

This code block is exist in [value token facet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueTokenFacet.sol#L16). It removes his value from the pool and it mints equal amount of value to the user

Later user can use `burn` function in the same contract in order to stake his value back again.

```solidity
    function burn(uint256 value, uint256 bgtValue, uint16 _cid) external {
        require(bgtValue <= value, InsufficientValueForBgt(value, bgtValue));
        _burn(msg.sender, value);
        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_cid);
        Closure storage c = Store.closure(cid); // Validates cid.
        c.stakeValue(value, bgtValue);
        Store.assets().add(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
    }
```

The problem occurs exactly in here because let say Alice had 1000 value and she minted that value from cid=16 (all tokens included). But later she wanted to stake her value to cid=15 ( different closure 1 token excluded ). The system directly increase the other closure's total staked value and it adds value to her account in Asset.sol contract.

```solidity
    function add(
        AssetBook storage self,
        address recipient,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 bgtValue
    ) internal {
        collect(self, recipient, cid);
        Asset storage a = self.assets[recipient][cid];
        require(value >= bgtValue, InsufficientValue(value, bgtValue));
        a.value += value;
        a.bgtValue += bgtValue;
    }
```

Closure storages are updated successfuly but it doesn't update the vaults. This is a big problem because each closures total shares is recorded separately. Therefore transfering the value won't be enough to stake her value back.

```solidity
        if (self.vType == VaultType.E4626) {
            getE4626(self).deposit(self.temp, cid, amount);
        } else {
            revert VaultTypeUnrecognized(self.vType);
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

1. Alice added 1000 value to closure = 15 ( only one token excluded ) by depositing 1000 amount of tokens for all tokens
2. She unstaked her 1000 value and contract minted 1000 token to Alice
3. Alice burned but she added her value to closure = 16 ( all included ) 
4. Now, vault storage didn't change but her value is transferred to closure = 16
5. Bob was in closure=16
6. Alice withdrawn her tokens from closure=16
7. Bob lost his funds because Alice actually withdrawn Bob's tokens

### Impact

Loss of funds for all the users in the corresponding closure. Fee's also impacted from the situation because closure's total staked value will increase after burning and it will also cause loss of yield for that closure. In the end, it will cause a big insolvency because anyone can do that and the recorded balances will collapse massively.

### Mitigation

Fix is not trivial if it's intended but if it's unintended use ERC1155 and mint different tokens for different closures
