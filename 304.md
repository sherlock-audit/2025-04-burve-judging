# Zero Tax Calculation Due to Uninitialized Variable Usage

### Summary

In removeValueSingle(), tax calculation uses an uninitialized removedBalance variable instead of realRemoved, resulting in zero tax collection and protocol revenue loss. It will cause users performing single token withdrawal to not pay the tax.

### Root Cause

The function calculates realTax using [removedBalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L236) for calculation before it is initialized. Since uninitialized variables in Solidity default to zero, this results in realTax always being zero, regardless of the actual withdrawal amount.

          uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            removedBalance,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );

The calculation of realTax is done by multiplying removedBalance with nomialTax and then dividing with removedNomial. but the calculation should be [realRemoved](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L233) instead of removedBalance to calculate the realTax

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- User initiates withdrawal via removeValueSingle
- Function calculates realRemoved
- Tax calculation uses uninitialized removedBalance instead of realRemoved
- Tax is calculated as 0 (anything multiplied by 0)
- No tax is deducted from withdrawal amount
- User receives full realRemoved amount

### Impact

- Protocol loses fee revenue
- No tax collection on single token withdrawals

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the removedBalance with realRemoved

          uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            realRemoved,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );
