# Vertex Underfunding Due to Incorrect Tax Deduction in SwapFacet Contract

### Summary

The `SwapFacet` contract contains an issue where the tax (`realTax`) is calculated based on the full input amount (`inAmount`) but is not effectively charged to the user, leading to potential undercharging. The user transfers the full `inAmount` to the contract, and while `realTax` is deducted from this amount for deposit purposes, the user does not experience a reduction in their balance due to the tax. This discrepancy means the intended tax is not fully realized, potentially affecting the contract's financial integrity and balance. 



### Root Cause

The `SwapFacet` contract have a misalignment between the tax calculation and its application. Specifically, the tax (`realTax`) is calculated based on the full input amount (`inAmount`) but is not effectively deducted from the user's balance. 

This results in the user being charged the full `inAmount` without experiencing the intended tax deduction, leading to undercharging. The logic fails to ensure that the tax deduction is reflected in the user's transaction outcome.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The contract deducts `realTax` from `inAmount` before depositing into the vertex, which means the vertex receives less than the full amount transferred by the user. This could lead to a discrepancy in the vertex's balance, potentially affecting its ability to maintain accurate accounting and fulfill obligations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adjust the deposit logic to ensure the full `inAmount` is credited to the vertex, and handle the tax deduction separately and charge the tax speratly from `inAmount`.
