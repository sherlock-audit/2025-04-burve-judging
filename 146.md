# Shares rounding to zero: user deposits result in zero LP tokens

## Finding description and impact

The Burve protocol contains a potential issue where users depositing liquidity may receive zero shares (LP tokens) despite providing a non-zero amount of liquidity. This occurs due to a scaling mismatch between nominal liquidity values and shares (scaled by 10^18) in the share calculation formula, which becomes problematic as the pool accumulates fees over time. As trading fees are collected and compounded, they are added to `totalNominalLiq` (the denominator in the share calculation), causing it to continually increase while `totalShares` remains constant, progressively reducing the shares minted per unit of new liquidity.

The issue stems from the share calculation in the mint function:

A key mechanism in the Burve protocol is that trading fees collected from Uniswap V3 positions are automatically reinvested (compounded) through the `compoundV3Ranges` function. When this happens, `totalNominalLiq` increases without minting any new shares:

## Impact
This continuous increase in the denominator `totalNominalLiq` without a corresponding increase in the numerator `totalShares` creates a situation where the ratio between them steadily decreases over time. Eventually, for smaller deposits, the calculation can round down to zero due to integer division.

## Proof of Concept

Team initializes the pool:

  - Team deposits 100 units of nominal liquidity (required minimum deadshares)
  - totalShares = 100 × 10^18 (scaled by 18 decimals as per ERC-20 standard)
  - totalNominalLiq = 100 (unscaled, as per Uniswap V3 liquidity representation)

User 1 deposits:

  - User 1 deposits 10,000 units of nominal liquidity
  - Share calculation: (10,000 × 100 × 10^18) ÷ 100 = 10,000 × 10^18
  - User 1 receives 10,000 tokens
  - After deposit: totalShares = 10,100 × 10^18, totalNominalLiq = 10,100
 
User 2 deposits:

  - User 2 deposits 5,000 units of nominal liquidity
  - Share calculation: (5,000 × 10,100 × 10^18) ÷ 10,100 = 5,000 × 10^18
  - User 2 receives 5,000 tokens
  - After deposit: totalShares = 15,100 × 10^18, totalNominalLiq = 15,100


Fee Accumulation Phase

The pool operates successfully for some time, collecting and compounding trading fees:

  - Fees collected and compounded through automated mechanism: 1.51 × 10^22 units
  - These fees are added to totalNominalLiq without minting new shares
  - totalShares remains unchanged at 15,100 × 10^18
  - totalNominalLiq increases to 1.51 × 10^22 + 15,100 ≈ 1.51 × 10^22

User 3 attempts to deposit:

  - User 3 deposits 1 unit of nominal liquidity
  - Share calculation: (1 × 15,100 × 10^18) ÷ (1.51 × 10^22) = 15,100 × 10^18 ÷ (1.51 × 10^22) ≈ 0.1 (less than 1) = 0 (rounded down in integer division)

Despite depositing a positive amount of liquidity (1 unit), User 3 receives 0 shares. 

## Recommended mitigation steps

Implement a mechanism to reduce the ratio between totalNominalLiq and totalShares when it grows too large over time
