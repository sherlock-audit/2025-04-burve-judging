# Contract logic flaw will mismatch internal and external vault shares, potentially trapping user funds.

### Summary

Incorrect order of operations in the [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L104)/[withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L130) netting logic within the `commit` function will cause a share accounting discrepancy for vault users as the contract's `commit` function will incorrectly calculate the net withdrawal amount during batch operations where withdrawals exceed deposits, leading to burning more external shares (`totalVaultShares`) than accounted for internally (`totalShares`), potentially preventing future withdrawals.

### Root Cause

In `src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol:71` the `assetsToDeposit` variable is zeroed out before it is subtracted from `assetsToWithdraw` within the netting logic block for the `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit` condition.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  Any user needs to interact with the system using `VaultE4626` to enqueue deposits and withdrawals within a single transaction such that the aggregated `assetsToWithdraw` in `temp.vars[2]` becomes greater than the aggregated `assetsToDeposit` in `temp.vars[1]` before the `commit` function is executed.


### External Pre-conditions

1.  The underlying `IERC4626` vault must be operational and allow withdrawals.


### Attack Path

1.  A transaction context begins, likely initiated by a user interaction.
2.  The system calls `VaultE4626Impl.fetch`, populating a `VaultTemp` struct.
3.  One or more calls to `VaultE4626Impl.deposit` occur within the transaction, increasing `temp.vars[1]` and `self.totalShares`.
4.  One or more calls to `VaultE4626Impl.withdraw` occur within the transaction, increasing `temp.vars[2]` and decreasing `self.totalShares`. The total amount for `temp.vars[2]` must exceed the total for `temp.vars[1]`.
5.  The system calls `VaultE4626Impl.commit` with the populated `VaultTemp`.
6.  Inside `commit`, the logic block `else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit)` is executed.
7.  The line `assetsToDeposit = 0;` executes first.
8.  The line `assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;` executes next, having no effect as `assetsToDeposit` is 0.
9.  The contract calls `self.vault.withdraw` with the original, larger `assetsToWithdraw` value.
10. The external vault burns shares corresponding to the large withdrawal, and the returned amount correctly decreases `self.totalVaultShares`.
11. The transaction completes, leaving `self.totalVaultShares` (external) lower than `self.totalShares` (internal).


### Impact

Vault users cannot withdraw their full entitlement of assets corresponding to their internal shares (`shares[cid]`) because the contract holds fewer shares (`totalVaultShares`) in the underlying `IERC4626` vault than its internal accounting (`totalShares`) indicates it should based on user balances.
