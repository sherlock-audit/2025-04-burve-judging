# Closures do not support arbitrary rebasing tokens even with custom Adjustor, leading to permanent loss of user funds

### Summary

Closures do not support rebasing tokens, leading to permanent loss of user funds in LP. Custom adjustor can be too slow to adjust, or frontrun.

The contest README states rebasing tokens are supported.
> We allow for:
>
>   - rebasing tokens

**NOTICE THAT THE RULES SAY THIS IS A VALID ISSUE:**
> Note: if the (external) admin will unknowingly cause issues, it can be considered a valid issue.
> Example: Admin sets fee to 20%. This will cause liquidations to fail in case the utilization ratio is below 10%, this can be Medium as the admin is not aware of the consequences of his action.


### Root Cause

In Closure.sol, `self.balances` does not account for rebases. Therefore it will stay the same. In particular, `removeValueSingle`, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L246-L269:

The `fairVBalance` does not depend on the actual balance of the token as defined by the rebasing erc20. Suppose in the beginning a user deposits a single token (the rebasing token) as liquidity and receives a value. Then the rebasing doubles the supply and therefore the balance doubles. When the user attempts to remove the value he will only receive half of the real erc20 token balance as the supply has doubled, while the value in `self.balances` has not changed. Attempting to remove the other half of the token will fail as `self.balances[valIter.vIdx] - fairVBalance` will be negative. **Normally the `AdjustorLib` is supposed to handle this by converting all external balances internally to a non-rebasing balance, but it fails (explained later).** 

```solidity
    /// Remove value from a closure through a single token.
    function removeValueSingle(
        Closure storage self,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 bgtValue,
        VertexId vid
    ) internal returns (uint256 removedAmount, uint256 tax) {
        require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
        require(self.cid.contains(vid), IrrelevantVertex(self.cid, vid));
        trimAllBalances(self);
        uint256 scaleX128 = ONEX128 -
            FullMath.mulDivX256(value, self.n * self.targetX128, true);
        {
            uint256 valueX128 = value << 128;
            // Round leftover value up.
            self.targetX128 -= valueX128 / self.n;
        }
        SingleValueIter memory valIter = SingleValueIter({
            scaleX128: scaleX128,
            vIdx: vid.idx(),
            valueSumX128: 0
        });
        // We first calculate what value is effectively "added" by not removing the tokens.
        // And then we make sure to remove that amount of value with the out token.
        uint256 fairVBalance = iterSingleValueDiff(self, valIter, false);
        removedAmount = self.balances[valIter.vIdx] - fairVBalance;
```

See where it is actually transferred in ValueFacet.sol, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L214-L244:
```solidity
        (uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(
            value,
            bgtValue,
            vid
        );
        uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
        Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
        uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            removedBalance,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );
        c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
        removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax; // How much the user actually gets.
        require(removedBalance >= minReceive, PastSlippageBounds());
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, removedBalance);
```

The `AdjustorLib.toReal` can account for specific tokens which increase over time like with `E4626ViewAdjustor.sol`, but **it is impossible to construct an adjustor to handle arbitrary rebasing tokens** (as they are obviously arbitrary). The knowledge of a rebase may not even exist on chain.

The example with loss uses `NullAdjustor` which does no adjustment, but any deviation will be wrong and can result in more or less value being extracted.

The README states 
> The adjustors are properly configured.
> Off-chain systems will monitor any moving pegs and update the adjustor accordingly if that information is not available on-chain.

This is not enough. Suppose we have `CustomAdjustor` made for a rebasing token using off-chain information. But in the case of an arbitrary large shrinkage of the supply, it will be delayed and cannot be instant because it is off-chain, and in that case a user may withdraw much more value than is truly represented (again by calling `removeValueSingle` and relying on the withdrawn tokens being worth more) before the update is hit, either normally or through frontrun.

Because of this delay, for off-chain adjustors **any adjustor is briefly equal to `NullAdjustor`**.

Frontrunning increases chances but is not required because any bot could be slow, crash, or lose the transaction race.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Rebasing token used in a pool

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

Not an attack

### Impact

User funds are permanently locked in liquidity depending on how the rebasing token works. Users can also withdraw more funds than they deposited if the rebase goes the other way. This is high severity.

### PoC

Call a rebasing token RBT. Assume `NullAdjustor`.

1. User deposits RBT to a closure
2. User receives value `v`, smart contract balance is same
3. RBT rebases, supply doubles and never goes down
4. User tries to withdraw all value `v`
5. User only receives half of balance. `self.balances` of the closure goes to 0, the other half of the value cannot be withdrawn

Half of the user funds are locked forever in this scenario. The closure is also broken.

Again use a rebasing token RBT2. Assume `CustomRBT2Adjustor` using offchain info.
1. User A deposits 1 RBT2 to a closure.
2. User B deposits 1 RBT2 to the same closure.
3. RBT2 rebases, supply halves. Closure now has 1 RBT2
4. User B immediately sends transaction to withdraw all his value
5. Burve bot offchain sees rebase, sends transaction to `CustomRBT2Adjustor` to change to halve effective balances
6. User B's transaction wins, confirmed first (either through frontrun or because the Burve bot is just slow)
7. User B receives 1 RBT2 because the old adjustor value is still used. This is the entire closure balance, instantly doubling his money

In this scenario user B has gained free money at the cost of user A.

### Mitigation

Do not support arbitrary rebasing tokens. Restrict only to the ones for which a custom Adjustor can be written with on-chain info ONLY.
