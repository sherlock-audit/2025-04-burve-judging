# `Closure::removeTokenForValue()` truncates fractional value letting attacker bypass burn leading to break an invariant

### Summary

Using the truncated variable `value` instead of the fixed-point variable `valueX128` in the rounding check will cause an under-burn of value for every partial withdrawal. An attacker can repeatedly withdraw tiny fractions so that **0 value is burned while the pool target is reduced**, eventually violating the `targetX128 * n ≥ valueStaked` invariant.

### Root Cause

In [`Closure.sol:removeTokenForValue()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L371) the rounding condition uses the truncated integer `value` instead of the original 128-bit fixed-point `valueX128`.

```solidity
value  = valueX128 >> 128;              // integer part (truncates)
if ((value << 128) > 0) value += 1;     // SHOULD use valueX128
```

Because `value` has already been shifted right (`>> 128`), the expression  
`(value << 128)` is always `0` if `valueX128 < 2¹²⁸`, so the rounding path is never executed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `valueX128` must be `0 < valueX128 < 2¹²⁸`

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `ValueFacet::removeSingleForValue()` with a value that makes  
   `valueX128 = 2¹²⁷` (0.5 in 128-fp) so `value == 0`.
2. Function burns **0 value** but lowers `targetX128`.
3. Repeat step 1 many times until `targetX128 * n < valueStaked` 

### Impact

Break the invariant `targetX128 * n ≥ valueStaked` 

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Replace the rounding check with the correct variable:

```solidity
value = valueX128 >> 128;
if ((valueX128 << 128) > 0) {
    value += 1;                           // round up
}
```

This guarantees that any positive `valueX128` burns at least one token, preserving the invariant.
