# Lack of Validation for Pool Configuration

### Summary

**Finding Description and Impact**:
The Burve contract relies on proper configuration of the Uniswap V3 pool and ranges, but there's limited validation to ensure these configurations are correct. Improper configuration could lead to unexpected behavior, including incorrect price calculations and potential loss of funds.

The contract uses tick ranges and distribution weights to manage liquidity across different price ranges, but there's no validation that these ranges are properly ordered or that the weights sum to a valid total.


### Root Cause

**Vulnerable Code Location**:
- File: `src/single/Burve.sol`
- Constructor parameters: `ranges`, `distX96`
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L40

### Attack Path

**Exploitation Scenario**:
1. An admin configures the pool with overlapping or improperly ordered tick ranges
2. This causes liquidity to be concentrated incorrectly
3. Users experience unexpected slippage or inability to withdraw funds

### Impact

The contract uses tick ranges and distribution weights to manage liquidity across different price ranges, but there's no validation that these ranges are properly ordered or that the weights sum to a valid total.



### PoC

**Proof of Concept**:
While the contract includes some basic validation like checking for empty ranges:
```solidity
error NoRanges();
```

It's missing more comprehensive validation like ensuring ranges are properly ordered or that distribution weights are valid.

### Mitigation

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**:
1. Add comprehensive validation for tick ranges and distribution weights
