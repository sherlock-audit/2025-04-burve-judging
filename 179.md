# Missing Value‐Equality Enforcement in swapInExact & swapOutExact

### Title
 Missing Value‐Equality Enforcement in swapInExact & swapOutExact

### Severity
Impact: High.
•	A successful exploit can drain tokens from the pool at an unfavorable rate, siphoning value away from LPs.
Likelihood: Medium.
•	Exploitable through on‐chain calls by any user; requires only knowledge of current pool state and token decimals.

### Difficulty


### Type
Bug

### Target
src/multi/closure/Closure.sol

## Description

The Burve documentation specifies that [“Closures also allow traders to exchange one token for another in its set as long as the value exchange is equal.” ](https://arc.net/l/quote/owdmavan). However, neither `swapInExact` nor `swapOutExact` implements a direct check that the value debited from one token truly equals the value credited to the other. Both functions compute an implicit `valueExchangedX128` via the bonding‐curve math, update balances by that value, and transfer tokens based on balance deltas—but never assert that:
```solidity
valueIn  == valueOut
```
This omission allows a malicious caller to craft swaps where the pool’s computed `valueExchangedX128` is manipulated—via carefully chosen reorderings of rounding or by crafting edge‐case token amounts—so that they receive more output tokens than the equivalent input value removed.

https://arc.net/l/quote/owdmavan

however, there is no check in Closure.sol::swapInExact for vertices' values being equal

if value of out vertices is higher then value of in vertices, then line 
```solidity
 newOutValueX128 = currentOutValueX128 - valueExchangedX128;
``` 

can be incorrect as valueExchangedX128 may be different for both vertices, 
should check for values before calculating valueExchangedX128 for in and out Vid

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	Attacker observes the pool’s targetX128 and current balances for Token A and Token B.
	2.	They compute an inAmount such that, due to rounding in the two successive calls to ValueLib.v() and ValueLib.x(), the resulting outAmount is slightly larger in token units than fair value.
	3.	They call swapInExact(inVid, outVid, inAmount).
	4.	Because no equality check exists, the pool honors the computed outAmount and increases the attacker’s token B holdings at the expense of the pool’s reserves.
	5.	Repeating this over multiple small trades drains the pool’s value.


## Recommendations
Add an explicit invariant check at the end of each swap to ensure value parity:
```solidity
// After computing valueExchangedX128 for in and out:
uint256 valueInX128  = /* recompute ValueLib.v(...) before and after inAmount */;
uint256 valueOutX128 = /* recompute ValueLib.v(...) before and after newOutBalance */;

require(
    valueInX128 == valueOutX128,
    "Burve: swap value mismatch"
);
```
