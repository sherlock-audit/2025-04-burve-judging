# If the backupEx address is modified in the BGTExchanger contract, it may lead to overflow, resulting in users not being able to claim rewards.

### Summary

In the BGTExchanger contract, the backupEx address can be modified multiple times through the setBackup function. This may cause an underflow in the getOwed function.

In the getOwed function:
```solidity
    function getOwed(address caller) public view returns (uint256 _owed) {
        _owed = owed[caller];
        if (address(backupEx) != address(0)) {
            _owed += backupEx.getOwed(caller);
        }
@>        _owed -= withdrawn[caller];
    }
```
If backupEx1 is changed to backupEx2, the _owed1 calculated by backupEx1 may be greater than the _owed2 calculated by backupEx2. This can lead to an overflow of the line pointed to above, causing the BGTExchanger.withdraw() function to fail to be called, and the user will fail to claim the reward via the collectEarnings function.

Although the setBackup function can only be called by the owner, issues that the owner is not necessarily aware of the harm should be reported.

### Root Cause

In the [BGTExchanger](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L77) contract, modifying backupEx to a different address may cause the getOwed function to overflow.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The owner changes the backupEx address to a different address
2. The _owed2 returned after the modification is smaller than the original _owed1.

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. Users add mobility and collect rewards normally. 
2. The backupEx address is changed. 
3. Users may not be able to receive rewards due to underflow when they receive rewards again.

### Impact

Users may not be able to claim rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to restrict the setBackup function from being called again if backupEx already exists.
