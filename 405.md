# Closure can be initialized twice potentially corrupting the storage

### Summary
The initialization code in [ClosureImpl::init](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L80) could potentially be executed twice thereby corrupting storage

The snippet is shown below
```solidity
    function init(
        Closure storage self,
        ClosureId cid,
        uint256 target,
        uint256 baseFeeX128,
        uint256 protocolTakeX128
    ) internal returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] storage balancesNeeded) {
        self.cid = cid;
        self.targetX128 = target << 128;
        self.baseFeeX128 = baseFeeX128;
        self.protocolTakeX128 = protocolTakeX128;
        for (
            VertexId vIter = VertexLib.minId();
            !vIter.isStop();
            vIter = vIter.inc()
        ) {
            if (cid.contains(vIter)) {
                self.n += 1; // @audit i - will corrupt data
                // We don't need to check this assignment.
                self.balances[vIter.idx()] += target;
            }
        }
        require(self.n != 0, "InitEmptyClosure");
        // Tiny burned value.
        self.valueStaked += target * self.n;
        return self.balances;
    }
```

### Impact
There are two issues here
1. A closure instance could potentially be overwritten in storage by initializing another closure with the same vertex combination
2. initializing a closure instance twice thereby corrupting the stored data like the number of vertices (`Closure::n`)


### Mitigation
- Validate that a closure with the vertex combination have not already been initialized
