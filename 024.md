# Unsafe Downcasting in Burve Contract

## Summary
The Burve contract contains a critical vulnerability related to unsafe downcasting from uint256 to uint128 in multiple functions. This deterministic bug can cause transactions to revert when large values are involved, potentially blocking critical operations like burning liquidity and collecting fees, which could lead to permanent loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Details
In the Burve.sol contract, there are several instances where uint256 values are cast to uint128 without proper validation. If these values exceed the maximum value that can be stored in a uint128 (2^128 - 1), the transaction will revert due to an overflow error.

The most critical instance is in the `burnV3` function, where the contract attempts to collect tokens after burning liquidity:

From `src/single/Burve.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L437-#L450:

```solidity
function burnV3(TickRange memory range, uint128 liq) internal {
    (uint256 x, uint256 y) = pool.burn(range.lower, range.upper, liq);

    if (x > type(uint128).max) revert TooMuchBurnedAtOnce(liq, x, true);
    if (y > type(uint128).max) revert TooMuchBurnedAtOnce(liq, y, false);

    pool.collect(
        address(this),
        range.lower,
        range.upper,
        uint128(x),
        uint128(y)
    );
}
```

While the function does include checks to prevent overflow when casting `x` and `y` to uint128, it reverts the transaction if the values exceed the uint128 maximum. This means that if a user has accumulated a large amount of tokens in a position (more than 2^128 - 1), they will be unable to burn their liquidity and collect their tokens, effectively locking their funds in the contract.

Similar issues exist in other parts of the contract, including:

1. In the `burn` function, where `burnLiqNominal` is cast to uint128:

```solidity
uint128 burnLiqNominal = uint128(
    FullMath.mulDiv(shares, uint256(totalNominalLiq), totalShares)
);
```

2. In the `mint` function, where `liqInRange` is cast to uint128:

```solidity
uint128 liqInRange = uint128(
    shift96(uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true)
);
```

3. In the `compoundV3Ranges` function, where `compoundedNominalLiq` is cast to uint128:

```solidity
uint128 compoundedNominalLiq = collectAndCalcCompound();
```

These unsafe downcasts create a deterministic bug that will always occur when the values exceed the uint128 maximum, which is a realistic scenario for tokens with high values or in pools with significant liquidity.

## Impact
This vulnerability has several severe impacts:

1. **Permanent Fund Loss**: Users with large positions may be unable to withdraw their funds if the token amounts exceed the uint128 maximum, effectively locking their assets in the contract.

2. **Denial of Service**: Critical operations like burning liquidity and collecting fees may fail for large positions, preventing users from managing their investments.

3. **Protocol Instability**: The protocol may become unusable for large liquidity providers, reducing overall liquidity and stability.

4. **Forced Fragmentation**: Users may be forced to split their positions into smaller ones to avoid the uint128 limit, increasing gas costs and complexity.

The severity is classified as High because:
- It is a deterministic bug that will always occur under specific conditions
- It can lead to permanent loss of funds
- It affects core protocol operations
- It has no workaround once the condition is met

## Proof of Concept
Consider a scenario where a user has accumulated a large amount of tokens in a position:

1. A user provides liquidity to a pool with a token that has a high value or large supply
2. Over time, the position accumulates fees, increasing the token amounts
3. When the user tries to burn their liquidity and collect their tokens, if either token amount exceeds 2^128 - 1, the transaction will revert with a `TooMuchBurnedAtOnce` error
4. The user is unable to withdraw their funds, resulting in permanent loss

This can be demonstrated by examining the code and understanding the constraints:

1. The `burnV3` function calls `pool.burn()` which returns two uint256 values (`x` and `y`)
2. The function checks if either value exceeds uint128.max and reverts if they do
3. If a position accumulates more than 2^128 - 1 tokens (approximately 3.4 * 10^38), the function will revert
4. For tokens with 18 decimals, this is equivalent to 3.4 * 10^20 tokens, which is a large but realistic amount for high-value or high-supply tokens

The vulnerability is deterministic because:
- The check `if (x > type(uint128).max) revert TooMuchBurnedAtOnce(liq, x, true);` will always revert when `x` exceeds uint128.max
- There is no way to partially burn or collect tokens to avoid this limitation
- Once a position grows beyond this limit, it becomes permanently locked

## Root Cause
The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of uint128 for token amounts and liquidity values, which is insufficient for tokens with high values or large supplies. The contract attempts to handle this by checking for overflow before casting, but it reverts the transaction instead of handling the situation gracefully.

This is a design limitation that fails to account for the possibility of token amounts exceeding the uint128 maximum, which is a realistic scenario in DeFi.

## Code Snippet
From `src/single/Burve.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L437-#L450:

```solidity
function burnV3(TickRange memory range, uint128 liq) internal {
    (uint256 x, uint256 y) = pool.burn(range.lower, range.upper, liq);

    if (x > type(uint128).max) revert TooMuchBurnedAtOnce(liq, x, true);
    if (y > type(uint128).max) revert TooMuchBurnedAtOnce(liq, y, false);

    pool.collect(
        address(this),
        range.lower,
        range.upper,
        uint128(x),
        uint128(y)
    );
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several approaches to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Implement Partial Burns**: Instead of reverting when token amounts exceed uint128, implement a mechanism to burn and collect in multiple transactions:

```solidity
function burnV3(TickRange memory range, uint128 liq) internal {
    (uint256 x, uint256 y) = pool.burn(range.lower, range.upper, liq);

    // Collect up to uint128.max for each token
    uint128 collectX = x > type(uint128).max ? type(uint128).max : uint128(x);
    uint128 collectY = y > type(uint128).max ? type(uint128).max : uint128(y);

    pool.collect(
        address(this),
        range.lower,
        range.upper,
        collectX,
        collectY
    );

    // Store remaining amounts for future collection
    if (x > type(uint128).max || y > type(uint128).max) {
        uncollectedTokens[range.lower][range.upper][0] += x - collectX;
        uncollectedTokens[range.lower][range.upper][1] += y - collectY;
        emit UncollectedTokensStored(range.lower, range.upper, x - collectX, y - collectY);
    }
}

// Add a function to collect remaining tokens
function collectRemainingTokens(int24 lower, int24 upper) external {
    uint256 remaining0 = uncollectedTokens[lower][upper][0];
    uint256 remaining1 = uncollectedTokens[lower][upper][1];

    uint128 collect0 = remaining0 > type(uint128).max ? type(uint128).max : uint128(remaining0);
    uint128 collect1 = remaining1 > type(uint128).max ? type(uint128).max : uint128(remaining1);

    pool.collect(
        address(this),
        lower,
        upper,
        collect0,
        collect1
    );

    uncollectedTokens[lower][upper][0] -= collect0;
    uncollectedTokens[lower][upper][1] -= collect1;

    emit RemainingTokensCollected(lower, upper, collect0, collect1);
}
```

2. **Use Multiple Collect Calls**: Modify the burnV3 function to collect tokens in multiple calls if they exceed uint128:

```solidity
function burnV3(TickRange memory range, uint128 liq) internal {
    (uint256 x, uint256 y) = pool.burn(range.lower, range.upper, liq);

    // Collect token0
    while (x > 0) {
        uint128 collectAmount = x > type(uint128).max ? type(uint128).max : uint128(x);
        pool.collect(
            address(this),
            range.lower,
            range.upper,
            collectAmount,
            0
        );
        x -= collectAmount;
    }

    // Collect token1
    while (y > 0) {
        uint128 collectAmount = y > type(uint128).max ? type(uint128).max : uint128(y);
        pool.collect(
            address(this),
            range.lower,
            range.upper,
            0,
            collectAmount
        );
        y -= collectAmount;
    }
}
```

3. **Limit Position Sizes**: Implement checks to prevent positions from growing too large:

```solidity
function mint(...) {
    // Check that the resulting position won't be too large
    (uint256 expectedToken0, uint256 expectedToken1) = calculateExpectedTokens(...);
    require(expectedToken0 <= type(uint128).max, "Position too large for token0");
    require(expectedToken1 <= type(uint128).max, "Position too large for token1");

    // Proceed with mint
    ...
}
```

Option 1 or 2 is recommended as they provide the most flexibility and don't limit the protocol's functionality.
