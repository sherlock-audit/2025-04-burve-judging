# Burve contract fails to handle non-standard ERC20 name/symbol implementations

### Summary

The Burve contract's assumption that all ERC20 tokens implement name() and symbol() functions with string return types will cause a complete failure of contract deployment for pools containing tokens with non-standard implementations (like MKR) as these function calls will revert during construction.

### Root Cause

## Root Cause

In the Burve contract, there are two functions that directly cast addresses to ERC20 tokens and call `name()` and `symbol()` functions without any error handling:


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L1062-L1090

These functions assume all ERC20 tokens implement `name()` and `symbol()` with string return types, but some tokens (like MKR) implement them with bytes32 return types.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The Burve contract is being deployed with a Uniswap V3 pool containing at least one token with non-standard name() or symbol() implementation


### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A 

### Impact

While the system explicitly handles particular types of non-standard tokens (rebasing, missing return values, flash mintable), it unexpectedly fails with tokens like MKR that implement name()/symbol() as bytes32 instead of string. Since the failure occurs during contract construction, there is no recovery path once encountered. This effectively breaks the core expectation that any token pair meeting the documented inclusion criteria should be deployable in a Burve contract. 

### PoC

# High Level POC for the Name/Symbol Implementation Issue

## Setup

1. Deploy a standard Uniswap V3 pool with MKR and USDC tokens
    - MKR token implements name() and symbol() as bytes32 (non-standard)
    - USDC token implements name() and symbol() as string (standard)

## Reproduction Steps

1. Try to deploy the Burve contract using the following parameters:
    
  
    - _pool: address of the Uniswap V3 MKR/USDC pool
    - _island: address(0) (no island for simplicity)
    - _stationProxy: valid station proxy address
    - _ranges: array with one simple range
    - _weights: corresponding weights for the range
   
    
2. The deployment transaction will revert during the constructor because:
    
    - The constructor calls `ERC20(...)` to initialize using `nameFromPool(_pool)` and `symbolFromPool(_pool)`
    - These functions try to call `ERC20(t0).name()` and `ERC20(t0).symbol()` expecting string returns
    - When t0 is MKR, it returns bytes32 instead of string
    - This type mismatch causes ABI decoding to fail
    - The transaction reverts with no meaningful error message
3. This prevents deployment even though MKR meets all other token compatibility requirements documented by the protocol
