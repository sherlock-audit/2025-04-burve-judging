# Bypass of LP Token Accounting Using Transfers to address(0)

### Summary

The `_update` function in `Burve.sol` is designed to manage ERC20 token transfers and corresponding LP token movements via `stationProxy`. However, LP token transfer logic is skipped when either `from` or `to` is `address(0)`.

### Root Cause

LP tokens are not adjusted during zero-address transfers, creating a loophole for share inflation and value extraction.

# **Finding Description**

```solidity
/// Override the erc20 update function to handle island share and lp token moves.
function _update(
  address from,
  address to,
  uint256 value
) internal virtual override {
  // We handle mints and burns in their respective calls.
  // We just want to handle transfers between two valid addresses.
  if (
      from != address(0) &&
      to != address(0) &&
      address(island) != address(0)
  ) {
      // Move the island shares that correspond to the LP tokens being moved.
      uint256 islandTransfer = FullMath.mulDiv(
          islandSharesPerOwner[from],
          value,
          balanceOf(from)
      );

      islandSharesPerOwner[from] -= islandTransfer;
      // It doesn't matter if this is off by one because the user gets a percent of their island shares on burn.
      islandSharesPerOwner[to] += islandTransfer;
      // We withdraw from the station proxy so the burve earnings stop,
      // but the current owner can collect their earnings so far.
      stationProxy.withdrawLP(address(island), islandTransfer, from);

      SafeERC20.forceApprove(
          island,
          address(stationProxy),
          islandTransfer
      );
      stationProxy.depositLP(address(island), islandTransfer, to);
      SafeERC20.forceApprove(island, address(stationProxy), 0);
  }

  super._update(from, to, value);
}
```

The `_update` function is used when transferring ERC20 tokens within `Burve.sol`. It handles moving LP tokens through the `stationProxy`.

However, an issue arises when the sender transfers tokens to the `address(0)` (the zero address).

The `_update` function is designed not to move LP tokens when either `from` or `to` is the zero address.

This bug can be exploited in the following scenario, assuming only `isIsland` exists within the `ranges` array:

1. The attacker mints 1000 tokens.
2. The attacker transfers 900 ERC20 tokens to `address(0)` â€” no LP token movement occurs in this step.
3. The attacker calls the `burn` function to burn 100 ERC20 tokens and withdraws the corresponding funds.

In this process, the attacker increases `totalShares` without incurring any actual loss.

```solidity
uint128 burnLiqNominal = uint128(
  FullMath.mulDiv(shares, uint256(totalNominalLiq), totalShares)
);

// adjust total nominal liquidity
totalNominalLiq -= burnLiqNominal;

uint256 priorBalance0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 priorBalance1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this));

uint256 islandShares = 0;

// burn liquidity for each range
for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
  TickRange memory range = ranges[i];
  if (range.isIsland()) {
      islandShares = burnIsland(shares);
  } else {
      uint128 liqInRange = uint128(
          shift96(uint256(burnLiqNominal) * distX96[i], false)
      );
      if (liqInRange > 0) {
          burnV3(range, liqInRange);
      }
  }
}
```

The burn function code used to withdraw funds is shown above.

If totalShares increases without restriction, withdrawals will still function properly. 

However, since totalNominalLiq does not decrease, it may eventually become impossible to mint new tokens.

### Impact

- The attacker increases `totalShares` without actual loss.
- Although withdrawals still work, `totalNominalLiq` decreases incorrectly.
- Over time, this may prevent new mints due to mismatched liquidity ratios.
