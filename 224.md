# Systematic round-up vs. round-down mismatch leaks real liquidity until the last LP is under-collateralised

### Summary

Because [mint()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226-L264) uses `shift96(..., true)` (round up) and [burn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L350-L406) uses `shift96(..., false)` (round down), every deposit slightly over-credits real Uniswap liquidity while every withdrawal under-credits it. These per-range “crumbs” accumulate until the contract’s recorded nominal liquidity exceeds actual liquidity, eventually trapping the last LP’s funds

### Root Cause

`mint()`rounds up any fractional part → may mint an extra 1 unit per range.

```solidity
// in mint()
uint128 liqInRange = uint128( shift96(uint256(mintNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true) );
```

`burn()` rounds down → burns slightly less than the true share.
```solidity
// in burnV3()
uint128 liqInRange = uint128( shift96(uint256(burnNominalLiq) * distX96[i], false) );
```

Because there are `n = distX96.length ranges`, each deposit can add up to +n units of extra real liquidity that isn’t accounted in `totalNominalLiq`, and each withdrawal removes <n units. Over many ops, the gap grows

### Internal Pre-conditions

The pool must have ≥1 range (i.e. `distX96.length > 0`).

### External Pre-conditions

Many LP joins and exits over time to accumulate the rounding drift.

### Attack Path

No single “flash” exploit, but an attacker or set of honest users performing many small mints & burns can amplify the drift. Eventually, a final user’s burn call will see `totalNominalLiq > actualLiquidity` and will revert or under-return funds.

### Impact

Late-stage LPs can suffer a denial-of-service on their final burn, locking their capital for days or weeks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use the same `roundUp` flag on both mint and burn, so over- and under-rounding cancel out.
