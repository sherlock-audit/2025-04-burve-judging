# Kodiak Finance Unavailable on Non-Berachain Networks

### Summary

The `Burve` contract is designed to integrate with `KodiakIsland`, which is currently only available on the `Berachain` network. This poses a significant issue for planned deployments on other networks such as Monad, Base, Avalanche, HyperLiquid L1, BSC, and Arbitrum, where `KodiakIsland` is not available. As a result, the contract's functionality related to the island component will be potentially leading to unexpected behavior or operational failures on these networks. 



### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the dependency of the `Burve` contract on the `KodiakIsland` integration, which is only available on the Berachain network. This dependency creates a limitation because the contract is intended to be deployed on multiple networks, including Monad, Base, Avalanche, HyperLiquid L1, BSC, and Arbitrum, where IKodiakIsland is not available. Without this integration, the contract cannot fully function as designed on these other networks, leading to potential operational issues.

```solidity
@>      (uint256 mint0, uint256 mint1, uint256 mintShares) = island
            .getMintAmounts(amount0, amount1);

        islandSharesPerOwner[recipient] += mintShares;
        totalIslandShares += mintShares;

        // transfer required tokens to this contract
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            address(token0),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            mint0
        );
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            address(token1),
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            mint1
        );

        // approve transfer to the island
        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(island), amount0);
        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(island), amount1);

@>      island.mint(mintShares, address(this));

        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(island), 0);
        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(island), 0);

        // deposit minted shares to the station proxy
        SafeERC20.forceApprove(island, address(stationProxy), mintShares);
        stationProxy.depositLP(address(island), mintShares, recipient);
        SafeERC20.forceApprove(island, address(stationProxy), 0);

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

1. Deploying `Burve` contract on chains other than Berachain

### Attack Path

**1. Deployment on Other Networks:**
When deploying on Monad, Base, Avalanche, HyperLiquid L1, BSC, or Arbitrum, the IKodiakIsland component cannot be initialized or used.

**2. Functionality Impact:**
Any functions or features within the Burve contract that rely on IKodiakIsland will fail or behave unexpectedly on these networks.

**3. Potential Errors:**
Calls to `mintIsland`, `burnIsland`, and other island-related functions will not execute properly, potentially leading to contract failures or halted operations.

### Impact

1. The `Burve` contract's island-related functionalities, such as `mintIsland` and `burnIsland`, will be non-operational on networks other than Berachain.
2. Attempts to execute island-dependent functions on unsupported networks may result in transaction failures or contract errors.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Avoid deploying on chains that do not support Kodiak Finance.
