# Use of slot0 can lead to price manipulations Causing a loss of funds

### Summary

In the Burve.sol contract, the functions mintIsland  use the slot0 function of the IUniswapV3Pool interface to get the value of sqrtPriceX96. The sqrtPriceX96 obtained from UniswapV3.slot0 represents the most recent data point and can be easily manipulated via MEV (Miner Extractable Value) bots and flash loans.
This manipulation can lead to sandwich attacks, where the price is artificially inflated or deflated before mint function of  Burve.sol contract called, causing a loss of funds in Kodiak island.

### Root Cause

The functions mintIsland of Burve.sol contract  use the sqrtPriceX96 of  slot0 function of the IUniswapV3Pool to calculate the amount need to mint shares of Kodiak island.

Although function mint(the caller of function mintIsland) uses the modifier withinSqrtPX96Limits to limit the price returned by slot0, but the lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96 and upperSqrtPriceLimitX96 used by withinSqrtPX96Limits are passed by user who calls mint, also can be  manipulated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1 Burve.sol contract  uses Kodiak island.

### External Pre-conditions

1 Malicious users manipulate the UniswapV3Pool used by Burve.sol contract  via flashloans

### Attack Path

1 Malicious users manipulate the slot0 of UniswapV3Pool used by Burve.sol contract  via flashloans
2 Malicious users call mint function of Burve.sol contract right after the manipulation via MEV. The mint function calls  mintIsland function, user cant mint the same  islandShares with less tokens.
3 Malicious users  call burn function of Burve.sol contract to burn the islandShares to get more tokens commpared to the deposited tokens.

### Impact

Steal the tokens or the funds in  Kodiak island.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use The TWAP to get the value of sqrtPrice.
