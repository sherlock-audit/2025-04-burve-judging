# Incorrect islandShares Transfer Causes Permanent Loss of Island Yield Rights

### Summary

In the Burve contract, when LP tokens are transferred via the internal _update() function, the corresponding islandShares (representing stake in an auxiliary pool) are proportionally transferred as well. However, if the sender’s LP balance is zero, the islandShares transfer calculation performs a division by zero or miscalculates the share transfer. This results in loss or misattribution of the sender’s island stake, permanently blocking their ability to redeem or burn their share of the island pool, leading to yield loss or theft.

### Root Cause

The core issue lies in this line inside _update():

```solidity
uint256 islandTransfer = FullMath.mulDiv(
    islandSharesPerOwner[from],
    value,
    balanceOf(from)
);
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L713
```
If balanceOf(from) is zero, this operation results in a division by zero (hard revert) or, if unchecked, can yield an invalid value. Even in non-zero edge cases, incorrect rounding or underflows can cause partial or full loss of islandShares, as this proportionally transfers ownership rights without tracking whether the source truly intended to transfer yield entitlement.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user (from) has a non-zero islandSharesPerOwner[from]
- The user (from) has zero or near-zero LP token balance
- The _update() function is called via:
   - transfer()
   - transferFrom()
   - or any internal _mint/_burn hook if incorrectly used

### External Pre-conditions

- The protocol is deployed with the island component enabled
- Another contract, user, or protocol calls transferFrom(from, to, value) without validating from’s balance
- Alternatively: malicious actor sends LP to another address without the user's consent using stale allowances

### Attack Path

1. A user (Alice) holds LP tokens and associated islandShares
2. Alice fully burns or transfers away her LP tokens, but still has non-zero islandSharesPerOwner
3. Later, a transferFrom(Alice, Someone, 1) is triggered (e.g., via DeFi vault interaction or bot)
4. Inside _update():
  - balanceOf(Alice) == 0
  - Division by zero occurs (hard revert) or disproportionate islandShares get transferred
5. results
  - Alice is unable to redeem her islandShares in burn()
  - Her future yield (in token0/token1) is either unrecoverable or credited to the wrong recipient

### Impact

Due to incorrect proportional transfer of islandShares during LP token transfers, users who fully burn or transfer their LP tokens may be unable to redeem their remaining islandShares. This results in a permanent loss of claimable yield from the island pool, even though the user still technically owns the rights
