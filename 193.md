# Single-Asset Minting Uses Manipulable Instant Balances Allowing Permanent LP Dilution

## Brief

The [ValueFacet.addValueSingle()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L100) flow mints “value” tokens against a single-asset deposit, but the amount of underlying requested is computed from the *current* token balances held by the target `Closure`.

Because those balances can be moved arbitrarily within the same transaction through the public `SwapFacet.swap()` function, an attacker can:

1. flash-loan / swap liquidity to distort the internal balances,
2. call `addValueSingle()` while the pool is in that distorted state, and
3. restore the balances and repay the flash-loan,

thereby paying far less than the economically correct amount while receiving the full amount of permanently-minted “value” tokens.

The protocol keeps no time–weighted checks or historic references, so the discount persists, permanently diluting every honest LP.

## Details

### 1. Immediate balance-dependence in `addValueSingle`

```solidity
(uint256 nominalRequired, uint256 nominalTax) =
        c.addValueSingle(value, bgtValue, vid);   // ← relies on live balances
...
requiredBalance = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, nominalRequired, true);
...
Store.assets().add(recipient, cid, value, bgtValue); // records full value

```

Inside `Closure.addValueSingle()` the “fair” balance for the deposit token is derived as:

```solidity
uint256 fairVBalance = iterSingleValueDiff(self, valIter, true);   // ← uses self.balances[i]
requiredAmount      = fairVBalance - self.balances[idx];
...
finalAmount = ValueLib.x(... currentValueX128 + valIter.valueSumX128, true);
requiredAmount += taxedRequired;

```

All inputs (`self.balances[…]`) are the instantaneous balances recorded after `trimAllBalances()`, which itself just syncs to the same on-chain balances—there is no TWAP, oracle or block delay.

### 2. Balances are user-controllable in-tx

```solidity
function swap(...) external nonReentrant returns (...) {
    ...
    (nominalOut, nominalTax, valueExchangedX128) =
           c.swapInExact(inVid, outVid, nominalIn);   // mutates self.balances
    ...
    Store.vertex(inVid).deposit(cid, inAmount - realTax);
    Store.vertex(outVid).withdraw(cid, outAmount, true); // ← state update
}

```

`SwapFacet.swap()` is permissionless; it updates the same `Closure` balances immediately.

Bounds in `setBalance()` allow every token to vary between

`minX = t / (e+2)`  (≈ 8 % of target when e = 10) and `maxX = 2 × target`.

Thus a user can, inside one transaction, drain up to ~92 % of a token’s balance (still above `minX`) or stuff it to 200 % of target—ample leverage for manipulation.

### 3. Non-linear pricing amplifies the discount

`ValueLib.v()` implements

`v = (e+2)t − (e+1)² t² / (x + e·t)`

so the marginal value of each extra token falls as `x` rises.

By first *withdrawing* token *j* to push `x_j` well below `t`, the attacker makes the pool believe additional units of *j* are highly valuable; yet `requiredAmount` is proportional to the now-small `x_j`.

Concrete illustration (n = 2, e = 10, t = 100):


Stage | x_j | User-requested value | Tokens demanded
-- | -- | -- | --
Honest mint | 100 | 100 | ≈ 50 j
After draining to 15 j | 15 | 100 | ≈ 7 j

The difference (~43 j) is pure profit.

### 4. Permanent accounting

After the discounted deposit,

```solidity
Store.assets().add(...)
```

credits the attacker with the full `value` balance; these tokens:

- earn a share of all future fees,
- can be unstaked and swapped out for real assets later,
- remain even after the flash-loan is repaid and balances normalise.

### 5. Why existing checks fail

- **`MIN_SWAP_SIZE` (16 e8 nominal)** – trivial under flash-loan volumes.
- **Slippage cap `maxRequired`** – attacker sets it high themselves.
- **Re-entrancy guard** – attack is single-tx, no re-entrancy.
- **Balance bounds** – still leave a 12× spread (0.08 t … 2 t) exploitable.

## Impact

A single transaction can mint an arbitrarily large amount of “value” tokens for a fraction of their real cost, permanently diluting every existing LP and draining the pool’s future fee stream.  The only limit is the available flash-loan liquidity and the (generous) balance bounds.
