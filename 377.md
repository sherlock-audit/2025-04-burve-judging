# If kodiakIsalnd become restricted or `paused` users wont be able to burn or mint shares

### Summary
Kodiak island can be paused, or its minting feature become restricted, this cases are not handled in the Burve single pool, the burve pools will be puased as long as kodiak islands are paused.

### Root Cause
`KodiakIsland::mint` function has a check which prevents mints if island is paused, or restricted:
```solidity
    function mint(uint256 mintAmount, address receiver) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1, uint128 liquidityMinted) {
        require(!restrictedMint || msg.sender == _manager || !isManaged(), "restricted");
```
`KodiakIsland:burn` also prevents burns if island is paused:
```solidity
    function burn(uint256 burnAmount, address receiver) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1, uint128 liquidityBurned) {
```
if a single-pool is integrated with an island (`address(island) != address(0)`) and in some circumstance the pool get paused or restricted, then users will be unable to mint/burn shares (if paused) or burn their shares (if restricted or paused)

### Internal Pre-conditions
- `address(island) != address(0)`
- `distX96[0] > 0`

### External Pre-conditions
- `Kodiak::restrictedMint == true || Kodiak::isPaused == true`

### Attack Path
---

### Impact
Burve pools will be paused as long as the islands are paused or restricted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Implement a backup plan to be able to skip the island if its paused or restricted temporary.
