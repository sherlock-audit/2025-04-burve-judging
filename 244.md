# Missing Tick Spacing Validation for First Range

### Summary

The constructor skips validation for whether the **first range’s `lower` and `upper` ticks are separated correctly by `tickSpacing`**. If this range is misaligned (not a multiple of `tickSpacing`), Uniswap/kodiak will revert for any further operations as first range is not correct. The check is correctly applied to subsequent ranges but is missing for the first one

### Root Cause

The validation for tick alignment is not applied to the first range in the Burve Constructor. As a result, the first range could have invalid boundaries which violates Uniswap's requirement for ticks to be multiples of tickSpacing

```solidity
        uint256 rangeIndex = 0;

        // copy optional island range to storage
        if (hasIsland) {
            TickRange memory range = _ranges[rangeIndex];
            if (!range.isIsland()) revert InvalidIslandRange();

    ->   /* @audit below check is missing before adding range in the storage array
            if (
                (range.lower % tickSpacing != 0) ||
                (range.upper % tickSpacing != 0)
                ) {
                    revert InvalidRange(range.lower, range.upper);
                }
        */
            ranges.push(range);
            ++rangeIndex;
        }
```

### Impact

- Uniswap V3’s `mint()` operations will **revert** during pool interaction.
- This bug requires new deployment of the Burve contract which leads to loss of deployment gas funds.

### PoC

1. Create Burve Single pool contract by adding first range => (range.lower % tickSpacing) + 1
2. Check constructor is created successfully
3. Call Burve.mint() function and see it will always reverts

### Mitigation

Apply the above before pushing first range into the storage.


```solidity
        uint256 rangeIndex = 0;
        // copy optional island range to storage
        if (hasIsland) {
            TickRange memory range = _ranges[rangeIndex];
            if (!range.isIsland()) revert InvalidIslandRange();

    ->   /* @audit Add the validation like this*/
          if (
              (range.lower % tickSpacing != 0) ||
              (range.upper % tickSpacing != 0)
              ) {
                  revert InvalidRange(range.lower, range.upper);
              }
    
            ranges.push(range);
            ++rangeIndex;
        }
```
