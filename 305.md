# Incorrect Asset Withdrawal Calculation Due to Variable Reset

### Summary

In the commit() function of [E4626.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L72-L73), there's a critical bug where assetsToWithdraw is decremented by assetsToDeposit after assetsToDeposit has been set to 0, resulting in incorrect withdrawal amounts. The commit function is used when depositing, withdrawing or transferring assets. This bug will cause more amount to be withdrawn due to not decreasing by assetsToDeposit.

### Root Cause

The code sets assetsToDeposit = 0 before using its value to decrement assetsToWithdraw, effectively subtracting 0 instead of the original assetsToDeposit value.

          if (assetsToDeposit > assetsToWithdraw) {
                assetsToDeposit -= assetsToWithdraw;
                assetsToWithdraw = 0;
            } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
                assetsToDeposit = 0; // @audit setting to 0 before decreasing amount
                assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
            } else {
                // Perfect net!
                return;
            }

This would cause more to be withdrawn from the valut than required due to not subtracting the assetsToDeposit which may lead to reverts when trying to withdraw from the vault later.

### Internal Pre-conditions

assetsToWithdraw is greater than assetsToDeposit

### External Pre-conditions

None


### Impact

More assets would be withdrawn from the vault than expected leading to vault depletion and revert when users would later try to withdraw from vault.



### Mitigation

First decrease from assetsToWithdarw then set assetsToDeposit to 0.

           } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
                assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
                assetsToDeposit = 0;
