# users/withdrawers will not get full fees when burning their shares  in Burve contract.

### Summary

when the function burn is called which calls compoundV3Ranges function which calls collectV3Fees where fees are collected. But full fees are not  added to totalNominalLiq before user withdrawal,  so the user will not get/collect full fees.


### Root Cause

when the function burn is called which calls compoundV3Ranges function which calls collectV3Fees where fees are collected. But full fees are not  added to totalNominalLiq before user withdrawal,  so the user will not get/collect full fees.


### Internal Pre-conditions

 there must be collected fees in the  Burve contract before calling the  function burn.


### External Pre-conditions

the  Burve contract must have collected fees in uniswap v3  before calling the  function burn.



### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, there are two TickRange in the Burve contract i.e 0 index’s (_ranges[0]) TickRange is for island and 1 index’s (_ranges[1]) TickRange’s lower price range = 1500, upper price range = 2000. Here token1 = USDC, token0 = ETH. Here 0 index’s (_ranges[0]) TickRange’s weight = 0.5 and 1 index’s (_ranges[1]) TickRange’s weight = 0.5. 

2. Now a user want to burn his shares , so the function burn is called which calls compoundV3Ranges function which calls collectV3Fees where fees are collected, here token1’s fees are 5 usdc and  token0’s fees are 0.01 eth(16 usd as current eth price 1600 usdc).

3. Afterthat,  function collectAndCalcCompound is called where function getCompoundAmountsPerUnitNominalLiqX64 is called where getAmountsForLiquidity is called with 0.5 liquidity as 0 index’s range is skipped for island. So usdc = 0.002639 usdc and eth = 1.27 eth   are needed to provide 1 unit of Uniswap V3 liquidity in the range [1500, 2000], with the current price at 1600 USDC/ETH. So for 0.5 liquidity usdc(token1) = 0.0013196 USDC and eth(token0) = 0.6351 ETH are needed.

4. So getCompoundAmountsPerUnitNominalLiqX64 returns amount1InUnitLiqX64(usdc) = 0.0013196 and amount0InUnitLiqX64(eth) = 0.6351 in the  function collectAndCalcCompound. Now here nominalLiq0 = (collected0 << 64) / amount0InUnitLiqX64 = 0.1574, nominalLiq1 = (collected1 << 64) / amount1InUnitLiqX64 = 3790, as nominalLiq0 < nominalLiq1, so unsafeNominalLiq(always small number(in quantity) is taken between nominalLiq0 and nominalLiq1) = nominalLiq0 = 0.1574

5. Now unsafeNominalLiq i.e 0.1574(which is  fees ) is minted/added , so To provide 0.1574 units of liquidity in the range [1500, 2000] at current price 1600 USDC/ETH, 0.0004155 ETH and 0.1999 USDC are required which are transferred from burve contract(from collected fees) and totalNominalLiq is increased 0.1574 unit. 

6. Now the withdrawer/user will get less fees because full fees are not added/minted.  0.01 ETH−0.0004155 ETH=0.0095845 ETH as fees (15.3352 usd) , 5 - 0.1999 = 4.8 usdc as fees are still in burve contract. When the  user’s shares are burned , the user gets  a portion of totalNominalLiq(before where fees are increased), afterthat based on totalNominalLiq user gets back token0 and token1. But as full fees are not added to totalNominalLiq before user withdrawal , so the user will not get/collect full fees .

### Impact

when the function burn is called which calls compoundV3Ranges function which calls collectV3Fees where fees are collected. But full fees are not  added to totalNominalLiq before user withdrawal,  so the user will not get/collect full fees.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

make sure user gets full fees when burning their shares.
