# `burnIsland()` burns tokens it no longer owns resulting in permanent DoS for every LP that holds island-shares

### Summary

The [burnIsland()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L412-L432) internal function in `Burve.sol` withdraws the user’s island-share tokens to the caller, then immediately calls `island.burn()` on the Burve contract’s own balance. Since those shares were just sent to the user, the burn call reverts, permanently blocking any LP from successfully burning island shares and withdrawing their underlying assets.

### Root Cause

Incorrect withdrawal target send the LP tokens directly to the user

```solidity
stationProxy.withdrawLP(address(island), islandBurnShares, msg.sender);
```

Attempts to burn from the contract’s balance, which is now zero, causing a revert
```solidity
island.burn(islandBurnShares, address(this));

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

The user must have a non-zero `islandSharesPerOwner[msg.sender]`, so `islandBurnShares > 0`

### Attack Path

1. User holds island shares and calls `burn(…)`.
2. `burnIsland()` computes `islandBurnShares`.
3. `stationProxy.withdrawLP(..., msg.sender)` transfers shares to user.
4. `island.burn(islandBurnShares, address(this))` fails because the contract no longer owns those shares.
5. The entire `burn()` transaction reverts, locking the user’s capital and preventing any future burns.

### Impact

Permanent DoS for every LP that has ever received island shares: they can never successfully call `burn()` again

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


```solidity
 function burnIsland(uint256 shares) internal returns (uint256 islandBurnShares) {
     // …calc islandBurnShares…
     if (islandBurnShares == 0) return 0;

     islandSharesPerOwner[msg.sender] -= islandBurnShares;
     totalIslandShares -= islandBurnShares;

-    // withdraw burn shares to the user first (bug: user now holds them)
-    stationProxy.withdrawLP(address(island), islandBurnShares, msg.sender);
-    island.burn(islandBurnShares, address(this));
+    // ① withdraw to this contract so we can burn
+    stationProxy.withdrawLP(address(island), islandBurnShares, address(this));
+    // ② burn the shares from this contract
+    island.burn(islandBurnShares, address(this));
+    // ③ transfer any underlying assets or reimburse user as intended
+    //     (e.g., stationProxy.withdrawUnderlying(...) to msg.sender)

     return islandBurnShares;
 }
