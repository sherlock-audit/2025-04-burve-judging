# An attacker can drain assets from a Closure by exploiting the NoopVault via a donation attack

### Summary

The absence of protective mechanisms in the [NoopVault](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/pseudo4626/noopVault.sol#L6) as a vertex vault allows an attacker to exploit the ERC4626 standard's vulnerability to donation attacks. By front-running the first legitimate deposit and donating assets directly(without interacting with the valueFacet) to the vault without receiving shares, the attacker can manipulate the share-to-asset ratio. This manipulation enables the attacker to withdraw a disproportionate amount of assets, effectively draining each vertex in a  Closure.​


### Root Cause

There is no mechanism to prevent donation attacks, such as initializing the vault with a non-zero share supply or implementing virtual assets/shares. This omission allows an attacker to manipulate the vault's share-to-asset ratio by donating assets without receiving corresponding shares.

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin adds a new NoopVault as a vertex in the Burve protocol.
2. The vault has zero total supply and total assets upon initialization.
3. No initial deposit is made to the vault to set a baseline share-to-asset ratio.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Berachain, being an L1 blockchain, has a transparent mempool where pending transactions can be observed.
2. An attacker monitors the mempool for transactions adding new vertices (vaults) to the Burve protocol.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes a transaction in the mempool adding a new Vault as a vertex.
2. Before any legitimate user adds value through the valueFacet, the attacker front-runs by depositing a minimal amount (e.g., 1 wei) directly into the vault, receiving all the initial shares.
3. The attacker then donates a significant amount of assets directly to the vault without minting new shares, inflating the total assets.
4. A legitimate user deposits assets into the vault, expecting to receive shares proportional to their deposit. However, due to the inflated asset pool and the attacker's control of all shares, the user receives fewer shares than expected.
5. The attacker redeems their shares, withdrawing a disproportionate amount of assets from the vault, effectively draining the Closure.​

### Impact

Users suffer significant losses as their deposits yield fewer shares than expected, leading to a loss in asset value and the attacker gains assets equivalent to the legitimate users deposits without providing corresponding value. This attack can be cordinated to target all vertices in a closure and drain the whole closure.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement Virtual Assets/Shares: Incorporate virtual assets and shares in the vault's accounting to simulate an initial balance, mitigating the impact of donation attacks.
