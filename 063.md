# Improper Fee Allocation in Closure Contract Leads to Underpayment of Liquidity Providers

### Summary

The incorrect fee distribution logic in `Closure.sol` will cause a significant loss of earnings for liquidity providers (LPs) as the BGT allocation will disproportionately reduce their share of fees.




https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L662C5-L703C6

### Root Cause

In `Closure.sol` within the `addEarnings` function, the BGT (bonus/staking token) allocation is calculated before the LP share, reducing the userAmount available for LPs. Specifically, the line userAmount -= bgtExAmount deducts the BGT share from the total userAmount, leaving LPs with only the remaining amount plus any unspent tokens from the bgtExchange. This results in LPs receiving very less of the intended fee share 

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol must have swap fees enabled (baseFeeX128 > 0)

The closure must have BGT staking enabled (bgtValueStaked > 0)

Swaps must be occurring through affected closures

The protocol take percentage must be set to 50% (protocolTakeX128 = 1 << 127)



### External Pre-conditions

The token must have sufficient liquidity for swaps

The token prices must be stable enough to allow profitable arbitrage

### Attack Path

1. Attacker notices the fee distribution miscalculation
2. Attacker becomes a BGT staker to maximize their share of misallocated fees
3. Regular users perform swaps, generating fees
4. Protocol collects correct total fees (25% of swap value)
5. Fee distribution:
   - Protocol gets correct 50% of fees (12.5% of swap)
   - BGT stakers get most of remaining fees (~18% of swap)
   - Regular LPs get minimal share (~7% of swap)

### Impact

Liquidity providers suffer a great loss of their expected fee earnings
BGT stakers gain disproportionate share of fees at LPs' expense

### PoC

copy and paste this test into the `SwapFacet.t.sol` file and run

```solidity
function testSwapWithFeeManipulationExploitation() public {
    vm.startPrank(owner);
    simplexFacet.setClosureFees(0x7, 1 << 126, 1 << 127); // 25% total fee, 50% to protocol
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // Add liquidity as uint128
    uint128 liquidityAmount = 100e18;
    valueFacet.addValue(alice, 0x7, liquidityAmount, 0);

    // Mint tokens for self-trading
    token0.mint(alice, 100e18);
    token1.mint(alice, 100e18);
    token0.approve(address(swapFacet), 100e18);
    token1.approve(address(swapFacet), 100e18);

    uint256 swapAmount = 10e18;
    uint256 initialBalance0 = token0.balanceOf(alice);

    // Perform self-trading: token0 -> token1 -> token0
    (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount1) = swapFacet.swap(
        alice,
        address(token0),
        address(token1),
        int256(swapAmount),
        0,
        0x7

    (uint256 inAmount2, uint256 outAmount0) = swapFacet.swap(

        address(token0),
        int256(outAmount1),
        0,
        0x7
    );

    // Correct fee calculation:
    // 1. First swap: 10e18 input * 25% fee = 2.5e18 total fees
    //    - Protocol gets 50% = 1.25e18
    //    - LPs get 50% = 1.25e18
    // 2. Second swap: ~7.5e18 input * 25% fee = ~1.875e18 total fees
    //    - Protocol gets 50% = ~0.9375e18
    //    - LPs get 50% = ~0.9375e18
    // Total LP fees: ~2.1875e18 (1.25 + 0.9375)
    uint256 expectedLpFees = 2187500000000000000; // ~2.1875 tokens
    
    console.log("Actual tax collected first swap:", inAmount - (swapAmount - (swapAmount * 25 / 100)));
    console.log("Actual tax collected second swap:", inAmount2 - (outAmount1 - (outAmount1 * 25 / 100)));

    // Remove liquidity and collect fees
    valueFacet.removeValue(alice, 0x7, liquidityAmount, 0);

    // Verify fee earnings
    (, , uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory earnings, ) = valueFacet.queryValue(alice, 0x7);
    assertGt(earnings[0], 0, "No fee earnings collected");
    console.log("Earnings[0]:", earnings[0]);
    console.log("Expected fees:", expectedLpFees);
    assertApproxEqAbs(
        earnings[0],
        expectedLpFees,
        1e17, // 0.1 token tolerance for rounding differences
        "Incorrect fee earnings"
    );
    assertGt(token0.balanceOf(alice), initialBalance0, "No net profit from fees");
    vm.stopPrank();
}

### Mitigation

To fix the vulnerability, modify the `addEarnings` function in Closure.sol to ensure LPs receive the full userAmount  before BGT allocation affects their share. The BGT allocation should be handled separately, potentially using unspent tokens or a different fee pool.
