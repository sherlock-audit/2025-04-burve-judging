# Unvalidated Vault Acceptance Leads to Fund Theft via Malicious ERC4626

### Summary

The lack of strict vault address validation in `VaultProxy.sol:acceptVault()` allows an attacker to insert malicious vault contracts, enabling deposit and withdrawal manipulation and potential fund theft.



### Root Cause

In [VaultProxy.sol:48](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L48), there is no validation on the vault address passed into acceptVault().
Specifically, the function allows any address without checks like:

```solidity
function acceptVault(VertexId vid, address v) external {
    load().vaults[vid] = VaultPointer.wrap(uint160(v));
}
```
There is no verification that v is a real vault (i.e., no interface check, no ERC4626 validation, no owner restrictions).



### Internal Pre-conditions

- Attacker submits a malicious vault via precommit mechanism.
- Admin (or auto-admin bot) calls acceptVault(maliciousVault).

### External Pre-conditions

None. No oracles, external events needed.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker precommits a malicious vault address.
2. Admin calls acceptVault().
3. Attacker's fake vault is now live.
4. Users deposit into fake vault.
5. Attacker steals assets inside the fake vault.

### Impact

Full theft of user funds deposited into the compromised vault.
Potential complete loss of reserves.

### PoC

```solidity
contract FakeVault {
    function deposit(uint256, address) external payable returns (uint256) {
        return 1;
    }
    function withdraw(uint256, address, address) external returns (uint256) {
        return 1;
    }
}
```

Attacker does:

```solidity
FakeVault fake = new FakeVault();
VaultProxy.acceptVault(vid, address(fake));
```

### Mitigation

- Validate that the vault:
  - Implements full ERC4626 correctly.
  - asset() matches expected asset.
  - convertToAssets() and convertToShares() have valid math.

- Restrict who can call acceptVault().
- Add sanity checks before accepting new vaults.
