# {Attacker} will trigger rounding errors and block user withdrawals using "E4626.sol::withdraw"



### Summary

Inconsistent rounding logic between deposits and withdrawals in **_[E4626.sol_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L146C1-L150C64)** will cause inaccurate share accounting for protocol users, as an attacker will create rounding dust through repeated small deposits and withdrawals, eventually blocking full withdrawal by users due to trapped shares

### Root Cause

In E4626.sol @lines  [117–121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L117C8-L121C11) and [142–145](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L146C1-L150C64):_

```solidity
//[ deposit() line 117-121]
uint256 discountedAmount = FullMath.mulX128(
    amount,
    temp.vars[3],
    false // Round down to round shares down.
);

// withdraw() line 142
uint256 sharesToRemove = FullMath.mulDiv(
    self.totalShares,
    amount,
    totalAssets
); // Rounds down, leaves some share dust in the vault.

```

The -deposit() logic uses rounding down, and -withdraw() logic also uses rounding down, which creates a mismatch where:

-     Fewer shares are minted during deposit,
-     More shares are needed to withdraw equivalent value,
-     And leftover dust cannot be redeemed, even though the protocol holds sufficient underlying assets.

Over time, this creates a discrepancy between shares and actual claimable assets, effectively locking user funds.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- [User needs to call deposit() multiple times] to set self.shares[cid] to be just enough to cover balance, minus rounding dust.
- [Protocol needs to use FullMath.mulDiv and mulX128] with opposite rounding assumptions between deposit and withdraw logic.
- [Protocol must not provide] any mechanism to round up during share redemption or sweep/share-dust.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Underlying ERC4626 vault must round conversions (via previewDeposit() / previewRedeem()) in a way that does not compensate for rounding errors in caller logic.
3. Asset pricing or yield generation must cause the vault’s totalAssets to fluctuate with small precision, triggering FullMath.mulDiv errors.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls deposit() ([line 104](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L104C1-L104C22)) repeatedly with small values.
3. Each deposit rounds down, minting slightly fewer shares than expected.
5.Attacker (or user) calls withdraw() (l[ine 130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L130C1-L130C23)) attempting to withdraw the full balance.
7. Because withdrawal uses FullMath.mulDiv with rounding down, more shares are required than available.
9. As a result, a small amount of shares (dust) remains in the vault — unwithdrawable.
11. Over time, attacker amplifies this effect by inflating self.totalShares to make dust more significant.
13. Users cannot withdraw all their assets, even though the vault holds sufficient funds.

### Impact

- The user cannot withdraw their full share of tokens, suffering a silent precision loss.
- This loss grows with time and usage and accumulates across users.
- The attacker gains no funds directly, but can grief the protocol by inflating self.totalShares, blocking fair exits for others.

### PoC

```solidity
function test_rounding_grief_blocks_withdraw() public {
    VaultE4626 storage v;
    VaultTemp memory temp;
    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(bytes32(uint256(1)));
    address vault = address(new MockERC4626()); // Mocked to simulate rounding errors

    v.init(address(token), vault);

    // Simulate small deposits to cause rounding dust
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        v.deposit(temp, cid, 1); // Small deposit to maximize rounding loss
    }

    uint128 userBalance = v.balance(temp, cid, false);
    v.withdraw(temp, cid, userBalance); // Attempt full withdrawal

    // Check for stuck shares
    assertGt(v.shares[cid], 0); // Remaining unredeemable shares
}

```


### Mitigation

1. Use consistent rounding across deposit() and withdraw() — either both round up, or track and compensate for rounding loss.
3. Add a sweep function to claim leftover dust or allow withdrawal of all remaining shares if below threshold.
5. Define a minimum withdrawal precision that ensures users can redeem all of their shares down to a final byte.
