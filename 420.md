# `compoundV3Ranges()` can revert causing funds to get stuck and blocking core operations

### Summary

[`compoundV3Ranges()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L785) is called to collect fees and compound them for each v3 range. and thereafter the liquidty is compounded into the the V3 pool for each distribution to achieve this, the approval is given to the V3 pool to spend the tokens when compounding, however this approval is given to the `Burve` contract instead of the V3 pool and ass such, if the fees are collected, the `compoundV3Ranges()` function will always revert.

### Root Cause


The problem is that instead of giving approval to the V3 pool to spend the funds, it is giving approval to the `Burve` contract and as such the liquidity cannot be provided successfully

```sol
File: Burve/src/single/Burve.sol
737:     /// @notice Collect fees and compound them for each v3 range.
738:     function compoundV3Ranges() internal {
739:         // collect fees
740:         collectV3Fees();

////SNIP
781:             totalMint0 += mint0;
782:             totalMint1 += mint1;
783:         }
784: 
785:         // approve mints
786:    @>   SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(this), totalMint0);
787:     @>  SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(this), totalMint1); 
788: 

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Fee have been earned and now being compounded

### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

NIL

### Impact

This leads to a loss of funds because, initially there are no fees, hence if Alice mints immediately after protocol seeds with `deadshares` assuming fees have not been earned, if by the time she decides to `burn()` fees have been earned, the fees will be collected but cannot be compounded and the `compoundV3Ranges()` function is called before `burn()` thus Alice funds are stuck in the pool.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `compoundV3Ranges()` function as shown below

```diff
File: Burve/src/single/Burve.sol
737:     /// @notice Collect fees and compound them for each v3 range.
738:     function compoundV3Ranges() internal {
739:         // collect fees
740:         collectV3Fees();

////SNIP
781:             totalMint0 += mint0;
782:             totalMint1 += mint1;
783:         }
784: 
785:         // approve mints
-786:        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(this), totalMint0);
-787:        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(this), totalMint1); 
+786:        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token0, address(pool), totalMint0);
+787:        SafeERC20.forceApprove(token1, address(pool), totalMint1); 
788:
