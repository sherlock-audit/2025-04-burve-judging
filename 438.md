# VaultProxy.withdraw can brick a vertex when backup vault is under‑funded

### Summary

A missing capacity check on the backup vault allows any caller to request a withdrawal that exceeds the backup’s withdrawable balance, permanently DoS‑ing that vertex because every withdrawal/trim that touches it will revert.

### Root Cause

In VaultProxy.sol the withdraw() helper only caps the amount that can be taken from the active vault (available), then blindly forwards the residual to the backup vault:

```solidity 
uint128 available = self.active.balance(cid, false);
uint256 maxWithdrawable = self.active.withdrawable();
if (maxWithdrawable < available) available = uint128(maxWithdrawable);

if (amount > available) {
    self.active.withdraw(cid, available);                // OK – bounded
    self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available);       // **unchecked**
} else {
    self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
}
```
withdraw()` for an ERC‑4626 vault reverts with `InsufficientBalance()` when the requested amount is larger than `previewRedeem(maxWithdraw)` can honour he active withdrawal executes first, the transaction will revert **after** tokens have already been moved out of the active vault; but the whole call is rolled back, leaving the state unchanged yet every subsequent attempt to trim or withdraw must still process the same oversized request, effectively freezing the vertex.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A vertex `vid` is configured with an **active** vault containing `A` tokens and a **backup** vault containing `B` tokens, where `B < backup.withdrawable()`.
2. Any user (no special role) calls a path that ends up in `VaultProxy.withdraw(vid, cid, amount)` with  
   `amount > A` **and** `amount - A > backup.withdrawable()

### External Pre-conditions

None. 

### Attack Path


1. The attacker (or any user) triggers a withdrawal/trim that passes the oversized `amount` to `VaultProxy.withdraw`.
2. `available` is computed only from the active vault and equals `A`.
3. `self.active.withdraw(cid, A)` succeeds and debits the active vault.
4. `self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount – A)` reverts with `InsufficientBalance` because the backup cannot supply that many tokens.
5. The whole transaction reverts, bubbling the error up to the caller.
6. Every future call that tries to operate on this vertex (including automated `trimBalance` in swaps, value adds/removals, etc.) re‑executes the same failing code path and reverts, **locking the vertex until an owner performs an emergency `hotSwap()` or manual balance top‑up**.

### Impact

**Users are unable to mint, burn, or swap any closure that relies on the affected vertex; effectively all funds routed through that token are frozen.**  
No direct monetary gain for the attacker is required—this is a **griefing DoS** that can be executed for the cost of a single failing transaction.

### PoC

**PoC (Hardhat pseudocode)**

```solidity 
// assume vid = USDC vertex
// active vault holds 100e6, backup vault holds 5e6, maxWithdraw = balance

await vertex.addValue(...);         // setup balances

const cid = 1;                      // any closure that uses vid
const amount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("101", 6); // 101 USDC > active.balance

await expect(
  simplexFacet.removeValueSingle(
      cid,
      amount,            // triggers Vertex.trimBalance → VaultProxy.withdraw
      0,                 // no BGT
      tokenUSDC.address,
      0                  // maxRequired
  )
).to.be.revertedWith("InsufficientBalance"); // thrown by backup vault
```
After this, every call that internally touches Vertex.trimBalance() will revert with the same error until governance swaps out the backup vault or tops up its balance.


### Mitigation

Pre‑check the backup capacity before performing any withdrawal
