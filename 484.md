# Incorrect total assets calculation due to unaccounted withdrawal fees in temp.vars[2]


## Summary
The temp.vars[2] in ERC4626 vault implementation fails to account for withdrawal fees, leading to an overestimation of total assets since the recorded withdrawal amount doesn't reflect the actual assets that will be removed after fees.

## Root Cause
In E4626.sol, the withdrawal tracking fails to account for fees:

```solidity
function withdraw(VaultE4626 storage self, VaultTemp memory temp, ClosureId cid, uint256 amount) internal {
    // ...existing code...
    temp.vars[2] += amount;  // Tracks full amount without considering fees
    // Actual withdrawal will remove: amount - fee
}
```

Example calculation:

User withdraws 100 tokens
Vault has 5% withdrawal fee
temp.vars[2] records 100
Actual withdrawal will be 95
Total assets overestimated by 5

## Pre-conditions

Internal Pre-conditions
ERC4626 vault must charge withdrawal fees
temp.vars[2] must track pending withdrawals
Multiple withdrawals must be pending

External Pre-conditions
Vault implementation includes withdrawal fees


## Attack Path
User requests withdrawal of 1000 tokens
System records:

```solidity
temp.vars[2] = 1000  // Full amount
```
Actual vault withdrawal (5% fee):

```solidity
Withdrawn = 950     // After fee
```
Total assets calculation:

```solodity
totalAssets = currentAssets + pending deposits - pending withdrawals
totalAssets = 10000 + 0 - 1000        // Incorrect
Should be: 10000 + 0 - 950            // Correct
```
System overestimates available assets by 50 tokens


## Impact
The protocol miscalculates available assets:

Total assets overestimated
Incorrect share price calculations
Potential excess share minting
Risk of insufficient assets for withdrawals

## Mitigation
Adjust withdrawal tracking to account for fees:

```solidity
function withdraw(
    VaultE4626 storage self, 
    VaultTemp memory temp, 
    ClosureId cid, 
    uint256 amount
) internal {
    // ...existing code...
    
    // Account for withdrawal fees
    uint256 amountAfterFee = self.active.vault.previewWithdraw(amount);
    temp.vars[2] += amountAfterFee;
    
    // ...remaining code...
}
```
