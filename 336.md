# A user burning a small share will lose value as liqInRange becomes zero and no liquidity is removed

### Summary

The use of shift96(burnLiqNominal * distX96[i], false) in burn() will cause a loss of proportional value for LP token holders as a user burning small shares will experience liqInRange == 0 across all ranges, leading to no liquidity being removed from the Uniswap V3 pool while their totalShares are still reduced.

### Root Cause

In [Burve.sol:379](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L379), the liqInRange value is computed with:

```solidity
uint128 liqInRange = uint128(shift96(uint256(burnLiqNominal) * distX96[i], false));
```

If burnLiqNominal * distX96[i] < 2^96, shift96(..., false) will floor the result to 0, causing no liquidity to be removed, even though the user is burning real shares and the contract reduces totalShares and totalNominalLiq.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user holds a small number of LP tokens
2. The number of V3 ranges is high, and/or distX96[i] is small for each range.
3. The product burnLiqNominal * distX96[i] < 2^96 for all i.

### External Pre-conditions

None required — this issue is internal to the contract’s accounting.

### Attack Path

Suppose:
- totalNominalLiq = 1_000
- totalShares = 1_000
- A user burns 9 shares

That means:
```solidity
burnLiqNominal = (9 * totalNominalLiq) / totalShares = 9
```
Now, say you have 10 ranges, and the distribution for each is roughly equal:
```solidity
distX96[i] ≈ (1 << 96) / 10 = 2**96 / 10
```
Then:
```solidity
burnLiqNominal * distX96[i] = 9 * (2^96 / 10) < 2^96
```
So liqInRange = 0 for every range.
And now:
- No actual V3 liquidity is burned.
- No tokens are returned to the user.
- But shares are still burned.

### Impact

The user suffers a complete loss of value for their LP token burn. They receive no token0/token1 output, yet their totalShares are reduced, and the value is effectively redistributed to the remaining LP holders.

This is a precision loss vulnerability, and although it’s not directly exploitable by an attacker for profit, it can:
- Frustrate users
- Break integrations expecting deterministic burn behavior
- Lead to griefing if attackers trigger accidental burns with 0 output

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a pre-check in burn() that prevents a burn if all liqInRange == 0, e.g.:
```solidity
bool hasValidBurn = false;
for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
    if (!ranges[i].isIsland()) {
        uint128 liqInRange = uint128(
            shift96(uint256(burnLiqNominal) * distX96[i], false)
        );
        if (liqInRange > 0) {
            hasValidBurn = true;
            break;
        }
    }
}
if (!hasValidBurn) revert BurnWouldYieldNothing();
```
