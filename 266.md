# When Mint and Burn, Remaining Fees Should Be Considered


### Summary
When mint and burn, fees deposit to the Uniswap V3 Pool. If the ratio of fees as `token0` and `token1` does not match the ratio of `token0` and `token1` in the Uniswap V3 Pool, there may be remaining fees in one token. These fees are not currently considered during minting and burning processes.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/tree/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L885-L899
This section indicates that remaining fees may exist.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/tree/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L226-290
The deposit function does not account for remaining fees.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/tree/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L350-L407
The burn function also fails to consider remaining fees.

### PoC
Consider the following scenario:
token0 = USDC, token1 = USDT.
Alice deposits 10,000 USDC and 10,000 USDT for 10,000 shares. After this, 90 USDC is generated as fees.
- Case 1: 
  If Alice burns her 10,000 shares, she only receives 10,000 USDC and 10,000 USDT, without receiving any of the accrued fees.
- Case 2:
  Bob deposits 20,000 USDC and 20,000 USDT for 20,000 shares. Bob donates 90 USDT to the protocol.
  When Bob burns his 20,000 shares, the 90 USDC and 90 USDT are treated as fees and deposited to the Uniswap V3 Pool. Consequently, Bob can receive 20,060 USDC and 20,060 USDT, which totals to 40,120 USD.
  As a result, Bob effectively steals 30 USD from the protocol.

```solidity
    function collectAndCalcCompound()
        ...
    {
        uint256 collected0 = token0.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 collected1 = token1.balanceOf(address(this));
        ...
    }
```

### Impact
1. Users are unable to claim their accrued fees.
2. An attacker can exploit this loophole to siphon rewards from the protocol.

### Mitigation
Consider modifying both the `deposit` and `burn` functions to ensure that any remaining fees are accurately accounted for.

        );
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(
            address(token1),
            msg.sender,

+            postBalance1 - priorBalance1 + priorBalance1 * shares / (totalShares + shares)
        );

        emit Burn(msg.sender, shares, islandShares);
    }
