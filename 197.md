# Use of `slot0` to get `sqrtPriceLimitX96` can lead to price manipulation

### Summary

The `mintIsland()` function uses Uniswap V3's `slot0()` to get the current square root price (`sqrtRatioX96`).  
This value can be manipulated easily using flash loans or sandwich attacks.  
As a result, an attacker can mint an unfair number of LP shares, causing losses to honest users.


### Root Cause
In [Burve.sol:300](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L300:L313)
```Solidity
(uint160 sqrtRatioX96, , , , , , ) = pool.slot0();

        (uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1) = getAmountsForLiquidity(
            sqrtRatioX96,
            liq,
            island.lowerTick(),
            island.upperTick(),
            true
        );
```

- the `sqrtPriceX96` is pulled from `Uniswap.slot0`, which is the most recent data point and can be manipulated easily via `MEV` bots and `Flashloans` with sandwich attacks.
- The attacker can manipulate `sqrtRatioX96` (the pool price) by executing **sandwich or flash loan attacks** on the underlying pool right before calling `mint`.    
- This causes the contract to **calculate token amounts incorrectly** or **mint more shares than they deserve.**

### Internal Pre-conditions

 - A user calls `mintIsland()` to mint LP 
 - The `pool.slot0()` value is read to get the current sqrt price (`sqrtRatioX96`).
 - `getAmountsForLiquidity()` uses this price to calculate how much of token0 and token1 the user needs to supply.
 - The user provides tokens and receives shares based on this calculated input.

### External Pre-conditions

- A Uniswap V3 pool is used and its `slot0()` can be manipulated by external 
- An attacker has access to enough capital to move the price in the pool (e.g., via a flash loan).
- There is no time-weighted average price (TWAP) protection in place.

### Attack Path

1.  **Attacker borrows** large amounts of token0 | token1 using a flash loan.
2.  **Performs a swap** on the underlying pool to change the price, pushing `sqrtRatioX96` to a high or low value.
3.  **Calls `mint()`** with a chosen `mintNominalLiq` and sets `lowerSqrtPriceLimitX96`/`upperSqrtPriceLimitX96` to include the manipulated price (bypasses the modifier).
4.  **Price-skewed calculations** allow the attacker to mint shares **cheaply or unfairly**, or require fewer real tokens in `mintIsland`.
5.  The attacker **completes the mint** and immediately restores the pool price by reversing the swap.
6.  **Flash loan is repaid**, attacker keeps extra minted shares or liquidity.

### Impact

- **Protocol share inflation**: Attacker mints more shares than 
- **User dilution**: Honest liquidity providers receive less share 
- **Economic loss**: If attacker withdraws or redeems, protocol or pool loses 
- **Repeatable** â€” the attack can be done multiple times for profit.

### PoC

1. Flash loan: Attacker borrows large token0 and/or token1 amounts.
2. Swap: Manipulate the price in Uniswap pool.
3. `Mint()` --> `mintIsland()`: Attacker mints LP shares using the manipulated price.
4. Restore: Revert price manipulation with opposite swap.
5. Repay: Pay back flash loan.
6. Result: Attacker keeps extra LP shares or earns unfair advantage.


### Mitigation
- Use the `TWAP` function to get the value of `sqrtPriceX96`.
