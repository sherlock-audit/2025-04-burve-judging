# Missing slippage protection when depositing into single pool

### Summary

When users deposit shares via `Burve.sol::mint`, they provide a `mintNominalLiquidity` amount. The number of shares to mint is computed as:

```solidity
(mintNominalLiquidity * totalShares) / totalNominalLiq
```

However, prior to this computation, the function `compoundV3Ranges` is invoked [[reference](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L739-L815)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L739-L815), which updates and increases `totalNominalLiq` by compounding. This results in the user receiving fewer shares than expected, potentially leading to unfavorable outcomes.

### Root Cause

The `Burve::mint` function lacks a `minShares` safeguard parameter, leaving users vulnerable to front-running via state changes that reduce the shares they receive.

### Internal Preconditions

* None

### External Preconditions

1. A swap or compounding event occurs while the user's mint transaction is pending, increasing `totalNominalLiq`.

### Attack Path

* None directly exploitable, but this introduces a griefing/donation vector where other users can manipulate the share rate to their advantage.

### Impact

* Users may receive fewer shares than intended.

### Proof of Concept

None

### Mitigation

Introduce a `minShares` parameter to the `Burve::mint` function. This ensures that if compounding causes the effective share rate to drop below a user-defined threshold, the transaction reverts, protecting users from unintended dilution.
