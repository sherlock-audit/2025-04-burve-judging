# Attacker will drain excess tokens from the vault

### Summary

The commit function is designed to net out overlapping deposits and withdrawals to reduce fees. But, in the branch that handles withdrawals exceeding deposits, the function resets the deposit amount (`assetsToDeposit`) to zero before subtracting it from the withdrawal amount (`assetsToWithdraw`). This leads to incorrect netting, where the full withdrawal amount is processed rather than the net amount.

### Root Cause

Issue is from the misordering in the netting logic. In the [branch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L61-L78
) where `assetsToWithdraw` exceeds `assetsToDeposit`, the code zeroes out `assetsToDeposit` before subtracting it from `assetsToWithdraw`, effectively subtracting zero. 

```solidity
if (assetsToDeposit > 0 && assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
    // We can net out and save ourselves some fees.
    if (assetsToDeposit > assetsToWithdraw) {
        assetsToDeposit -= assetsToWithdraw;
        assetsToWithdraw = 0;
    } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
        assetsToDeposit = 0;
        assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit; // BUG: subtracting zero instead of the original deposit
    } else {
        // Perfect net!
        return;
    }
}
```

### Attack Path

1. Suppose the vault currently holds 10 000 tokens.
2. A user submits a single batch that does:
- reserve(cid, 100) → wants to deposit 100
- trim(cid, 150) → wants to withdraw 150

Inside `commit`, we see

```solidity
assetsToDeposit  = 100  
assetsToWithdraw = 150  
```

Since both > 0 it enters the “netting” block.


##### Buggy path (withdraw > deposit):

```solidity
assetsToDeposit  = 0;  
assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;  // subtracts 0  
// ⇒ assetsToWithdraw remains 150
```

So the user end up withdrawing 150 and depositing 0, instead of the intended net withdrawal of 50.

In that way,
• The vault loses 150 tokens but only “sees” a 0-deposit.
• The user effectively siphoned an extra 100 tokens.
• Repeat this pattern on any closure and the user can drain the protocol.

### Impact

Because the netting never actually happens when withdraw > deposit, any batch that does a “trim” (withdraw) plus “reserve” (deposit) ends up withdrawing the full trim amount and skipping the deposit entirely. Concretelly, 

- withdrawals pull more assets out than users ever put back.
- Vault shares and user balances become misreported.
- Protocol is left permanently under-collateralized.
- An attacker can repeatedly issue withdraw+deposit batches to drain assets without ever restoring them.

In short, this bug lets an attacker siphon tokens out of the vault whenever they combine a withdrawal and deposit in one commit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reorder operations so subtraction occurs first, then zero:

```solidity
} else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
    assetsToDeposit = 0;
}
```
