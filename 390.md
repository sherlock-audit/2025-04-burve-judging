# Invalid vault address resolution leads to failed ERC4626 interactions

## Summary
Incorrect vault address resolution in E4626ViewAdjustor.sol will cause all operations to fail as the contract attempts to find ERC4626 functionality at token addresses rather than actual vault addresses.

## Root Cause
In E4626ViewAdjustor.sol:33 the contract incorrectly assumes ERC4626 vaults are deployed at their underlying token addresses:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/E4626ViewAdjustor.sol#L24

1. ERC4626 vaults are separate contracts from their underlying tokens
2. Current implementation tries to cast token address to IERC4626
3. Token contracts don't implement ERC4626 interface

```solidity
function getVault(address token) internal view returns (IERC4626 vault) {
    vault = IERC4626(token);  // Incorrect: Assumes vault at token address
    checkAsset(vault);
}
```

## Pre-conditions
Internal Pre-conditions

1. E4626ViewAdjustor must be initialized with underlying asset token

External Pre-conditions
1. ERC4626 vault must exist for the token
2. Vault must be deployed at different address than token


## Attack Path
1. Protocol initializes E4626ViewAdjustor with USDC as assetToken
2. User calls toNominal() with USDC token address
3. getVault() attempts to treat USDC contract as ERC4626
4. Transaction reverts due to invalid interface implementation


## Impact
The protocol cannot interact with any ERC4626 vaults, causing:

1. Complete failure of vault integrations
2. Inability to convert between nominal and real values
3. Blocked functionality for any systems depending on this adjustor


## Proof of Concept

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import {Test} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {E4626ViewAdjustor} from "../src/integrations/adjustor/E4626ViewAdjustor.sol";
import {MockToken} from "./mocks/MockToken.sol";
import {MockVault} from "./mocks/MockVault.sol";

contract E4626ViewAdjustorTest is Test {
    function testVaultAddressMismatch() public {
        // Deploy token and vault
        MockToken token = new MockToken();
        MockVault vault = new MockVault(address(token));
        
        // Initialize adjustor
        E4626ViewAdjustor adjustor = new E4626ViewAdjustor(address(token));
        
        // This fails because token address doesn't implement ERC4626
        vm.expectRevert();
        adjustor.toNominal(address(token), 100, true);
    }
}
```
## Mitigation
Add vault address tracking
