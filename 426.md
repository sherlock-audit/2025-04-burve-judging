# Per‑range rounding in collectAndCalcCompound() permanently locks small fee amounts (“dust‑loss”)

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L848

`collectAndCalcCompound()` forcibly zeroes every token fee balance that is ≤ distX96.length, which will cause a permanent loss of those fees for all LPs because any caller (even an honest user) triggers the rounding path that sets the amounts to zero, leaving the real tokens stranded inside the Burve contract.

{round‑to‑zero when collected ≤ N ranges} will cause a fee‑loss for liquidity providers as any user calling compound will set collected fees below the threshold to zero, effectively burning them.

### Root Cause

In [Burve.sol, function collectAndCalcCompound() lines ≈ 1020‑1033]* the contract performs:
```solidity 
// when split into n ranges the amount of tokens required can be rounded up
// we need to make sure the collected amount allows for this rounding
if (collected0 > distX96.length) {
    collected0 -= distX96.length;
} else {
    collected0 = 0;                      // ← fee dust wiped out
}

if (collected1 > distX96.length) {
    collected1 -= distX96.length;
} else {
    collected1 = 0;                      // ← fee dust wiped out
}
```
Setting collected{0,1} to zero does not transfer or compound the small amounts.
Those real ERC‑20 tokens stay in the contract but are never attributed to any LP share calculation again.

This is a pure‑logic mistake; it is not mitigated elsewhere. 


### Internal Pre-conditions


1. distX96.length is at least 1 (always true because the pool must have ≥ 1 range).


2. collectV3Fees() (called earlier in the same transaction) leaves collected0 ≤ distX96.length or collected1 ≤ distX96.length — i.e. each is ≤ 16 wei in the default 16‑range configuration.



No admin interaction is required; any public caller can satisfy these conditions simply by calling mint, burn, or any function that internally triggers compoundV3Ranges().



### External Pre-conditions

None. The bug relies only on on‑chain state within Burve; no oracle or price movement is needed.


### Attack Path


1. Normal trading and fee accrual leave a tiny fee balance (for example 10 wei of token0) in Burve.


2. Any actor (could be an LP claiming, or a front‑running bot) calls a Burve entry‑point that executes compoundV3Ranges().


3. Inside collectAndCalcCompound() the condition collected0 ≤ distX96.length is true, so collected0 is overwritten to zero.


4. The 10 wei remain inside the Burve contract balance but are never added to totalNominalLiq nor distributable via future withdrawals, because subsequent fee collections look only at the pool‑side delta, not leftover contract balance.


5. Repeating the scenario over hours/days accumulates an ever‑growing dust pot that no‑one can recover.


### Impact

Liquidity providers suffer a slow, permanent loss equal to the sum of all rounded‑away fees over the lifetime of the pool (upper‑bounded by distX96.length − 1 per compound call, e.g. up to 15 wei per token per call with 16 ranges).
Although each event is micro‑scale, an MEV bot can deliberately spam empty compoundV3Ranges() calls to accelerate the loss, griefing LPs at negligible gas cost.



### PoC

```solidity
function testDustLoss() public {
    //  Deploy Burve with 1 range, mock tokens & pool omitted for brevity.
    //  Assume token0 has 18 decimals → 1 wei visible.
    burve.depositFees(1, 0);         // helper: simulate pool owing 1 wei
    uint256 pre = token0.balanceOf(address(burve));
    vm.prank(alice);
    burve.mint(address(alice), 0, 0, type(uint160).max);  // triggers compound
    uint256 post = token0.balanceOf(address(burve));

    assertEq(pre, 1);                // fee was present
    assertEq(post, 1);               // dust still here
    (, uint256 query1) = burve.queryTVL(); 
    assertEq(query1, 0);             // BUT no LP can ever withdraw it
}
```

### Mitigation

Accumulate a per‑token dust bucket: keep collectedX in storage until it exceeds the per‑range rounding allowance, then compound.

Or: remove the else { collected* = 0; } branch and let tiny amounts compound; the small per‑range rounding difference is acceptable.
