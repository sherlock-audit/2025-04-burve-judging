# Incorrect distribution of compounded liquidity leaves fees un-used and inflates `totalNominalLiq`

### Summary

Skipping `isIsland()` ranges in `compoundV3Ranges()` while still adding the full `compoundedNominalLiq` to `totalNominalLiq` will cause a permanent under-allocation of compound fees, as any share belonging to island ranges is silently ignored.

### Root Cause

In [`Burve::compoundV3Ranges()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L739), the loop distributes  
  `compoundedNominalLiq * distX96[i]` **only for non-island ranges**,  
  but **`totalNominalLiq += compoundedNominalLiq;` is executed once before the loop**.

```solidity
uint128 compoundedNominalLiq = collectAndCalcCompound();   // <-- full amount
...
totalNominalLiq += compoundedNominalLiq;                   // <-- added in full

for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
    TickRange memory range = memRanges[i];

    if (range.isIsland()) {        // <-- nothing minted for islands
        continue;
    }

    uint128 compoundLiq = uint128(
        shift96(uint256(compoundedNominalLiq) * distX96[i], true)
    );
    ...
}
```

Because any `distX96[i]` that belongs to an island range is skipped, the sum of `compoundLiqs[i]` is **strictly lower** than `compoundedNominalLiq` whenever at least one island exists.  
The contract therefore:

1. Mints less liquidity than it books in `totalNominalLiq`.
2. Leaves the gap (fees) idle forever.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There is an island range
2. `distX96[i]` for that island is non-zero
3. `collectAndCalcCompound()` returns a positive `compoundedNominalLiq`.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Anyone (or the keeper) calls `compoundV3Ranges()`.
2. Function computes `compoundedNominalLiq = 100`.
3. Suppose an island range owns 10 % (`distX96[island] = 0.1`):
   * `totalNominalLiq += 100`
   * Loop skips island â‡’ only 90 units are actually minted.
4. The 10 unallocated units are neither minted nor accounted for, but
   the global counter claims they have been.

### Impact

Liquidity providers suffer a permanent loss equal to the skipped percentage of every compounding cycle (e.g. 10 % each time).  
`totalNominalLiq` becomes overstated, so future calculations that rely on it (withdrawals, share accounting, re-balancing, safety checks) use inflated numbers, potentially leading to:

* Incorrect share redemption amounts (users withdraw less than owed).
* Under-collateralization of positions using `totalNominalLiq` as reference.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Inside the loop, update the global counter only with the liquidity that is actually minted:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < distX96.length; ++i) {
    ...
    if (compoundLiq == 0) continue;

    totalNominalLiq += compoundLiq;      // move update here
    ...
}
```
