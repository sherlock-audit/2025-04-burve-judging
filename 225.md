# `valueStaked == bgtValueStaked` ➔ perpetual DoS

### Summary

If `valueStaked` ever equals [bgtValueStaked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L710), then

```solidity
uint256 nonBgtValueStaked = self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked;  // == 0
…  
self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] += (earnings << 128) / nonBgtValueStaked;  
```
divides by zero in `trimAllBalances()`, `addEarnings()`, and any other entry point that recomputes earnings, permanently reverting all core operations.


### Root Cause

The code assumes there is always some non-BGT value staked. It subtracts `bgtValueStaked` from `valueStaked` without guard, then uses that difference as a divisor. When they become equal, the divisor is zero.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The closure’s accounting allows staking purely as BGT (`stakeValue(value, bgtValue)`) without enforcing any non-BGT minimum

### External Pre-conditions

- An attacker or user stakes an amount entirely in BGT (so `bgtValueStaked` increases by that same amount).
- That same actor then removes all non-BGT value via `removeValue(...)` or `removeValueSingle(...)` until `valueStaked == bgtValueStaked`

### Attack Path

1. Call `stakeValue(X, X)` to add X of both value and BGT.
2. Call `removeValue(Y, 0)` repeatedly (or in one go) to drain every non-BGT cent, reaching `valueStaked == bgtValueStaked`.
3. Any subsequent call to `trimAllBalances()`, `addEarnings()`, or any function that starts by computing `nonBgtValueStaked` will do `(something) / 0` and revert.

### Impact

The entire closure’s core functions (mint, burn, swap, fee harvest, staking, etc.) become unusable—perpetual DoS on a core feature until the state is manually healed off-chain

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before any division by `nonBgtValueStaked`, enforce a positive minimum. 

```solidity
- uint256 nonBgtValueStaked = self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked;
+ uint256 nonBgtValueStaked = self.valueStaked - self.bgtValueStaked;
+ if (nonBgtValueStaked == 0) revert NoNonBgtValue();

… 

- self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] += (earnings << 128) / nonBgtValueStaked;
+ self.earningsPerValueX128[idx] += (earnings << 128) / nonBgtValueStaked;

```
