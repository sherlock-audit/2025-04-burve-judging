# Front‑Run Vulnerability in “Insecure First Mint” Dead‑Share Mechanism

### Summary

The contract’s first‑mint logic requires that the initial liquidity provider send at least `MIN_DEAD_SHARES` to the contract itself (`recipient == address(this)`) to burn “dead shares.” This check occurs after token transfers into the pool, opening a window where a front‑running attacker can observe a user’s first mint transaction, submit their own transaction with the same parameters but earlier nonce, and satisfy the dead‑share condition—thereby stealing user funds or pre‑empting the user’s mint.

       // Simplex/Burve (excerpt from mint):
       if (totalShares == 0) {
           // First mint must be dead‑shares to this contract
           shares = mintNominalLiq;
           if (shares < MIN_DEAD_SHARES) revert InsecureFirstMintAmount(shares);
           if (recipient != address(this)) revert InsecureFirstMintRecipient(recipient);
       } else {
           shares = FullMath.mulDiv(mintNominalLiq, totalShares, totalNominalLiq);
       }

### Root Cause

Race in First‑Mint Check: The `mint` function enforces the dead‑share requirement only by validating `shares >= MIN_DEAD_SHARES` and `recipient == address(this)` in the same transaction that also transfers user tokens into the pool.

Lack of Pre‑Check: There is no binding between the user’s intended parameters and on‑chain state; any pending first‑mint can be front‑run by a copycat transaction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `totalShares == 0` (contract has never been minted).

2. `MIN_DEAD_SHARES` is set (e.g. 100).

3. The `mint` function logic for first‑mint executes its dead‑share branch.



### External Pre-conditions

1. A user submits a first‑mint transaction with `recipient = address(this)` and `mintNominalLiq >= MIN_DEAD_SHARES`.

2. Transaction is pending in the mempool long enough for front‑runners to see it.

### Attack Path

1. User Submission: Alice submits `mint(recipient = this, mintNominalLiq = X ≥ MIN_DEAD_SHARES)`, intending to burn dead shares.

2. Mempool Observation: Attacker’s bot sees Alice’s pending transaction.

3. Front‑Run: Attacker sends an identical `mint` with same `mintNominalLiq` and `recipient = this`, but with higher gas price.

4. Attack Transaction Mines First: Attacker’s transaction succeeds—contract’s `totalShares` goes from 0 → `shares`; dead shares are burned.

5. User Transaction Fails or Becomes Meaningless: On Alice’s transaction, `totalShares != 0`, so the “first‑mint” branch is no longer taken and she gets ordinary shares at 1:1 with `mintNominalLiq`. Worse, she may end up with fewer shares per liquidity.

6. Funds Loss: Alice ends up overpaying for her liquidity or having her tokens misallocated.

### Impact

User loses value by paying full price instead of dead‑share price.

Attacker can prevent legitimate first‑mint, rendering pool unusable for rightful deployers.

### PoC

       // Pseudocode for bot:
       await provider.onPending(tx => {
         if (tx.to == Burve.address && tx.data.includes("mintNominalLiq")) {
           const frontRun = {
             to: Burve.address,
             data: tx.data,
             gasPrice: tx.gasPrice.mul(110).div(100) // +10%
            };
           sendTransaction(frontRun);
         }

The bot mines first, capturing the “first mint” slot.

### Mitigation

The logic should be moved behind a commit‑reveal or owner‑only initialization to prevent front‑running.
