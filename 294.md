# `VaultProxyImpl::withdraw()` unexpectedly reverts when backup vault is unset or under-funded

### Summary

Unchecked invocation of the backup vault will cause an unexpected revert for users: whenever the active vault cannot cover the full withdrawal, the function blindly calls `backup.withdraw()` which reverts if the backup vault is either (1) not configured or (2) lacks enough liquidity. This produces a user-facing failure (withdrawal reverts) even though part of the requested funds were readily available.

### Root Cause

In [`VaultProxyImpl::withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L187) the second branch performs no safety checks before interacting with the backup vault.

```solidity
if (amount > available) {
    self.active.withdraw(cid, available);          // ✅ guarded
    self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available); // ❌ may revert
} else {
    self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
}
```

Neither  
1. `address(self.backup) != address(0)` nor  
2. `self.backup.withdrawable() >= amount - available`  

Are verified, so the call reverts in unexpected situations.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User requests `amount` such that `amount > available` on active vault -> Possible when active vault take fees
2. `vStore.backups[vid] == address(0)` *or* the backup vault’s `withdrawable()` balance is smaller than `amount - available`.  Last point is possible if the vault is new.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `withdraw(cid, amount)` with an amount that exceeds the active vault’s liquidity.  
2. Function sends `available` to the user successfully.  
3. The subsequent unchecked call to `backup.withdraw()` reverts because the backup vault is zero or under-funded.  
4. The whole transaction reverts, returning nothing to the user even though enough funds were partially available.

### Impact

Users experience unexpected reverts and cannot withdraw until either  
-  A valid, sufficiently funded backup vault is configured
-  Lower the requested amount below the active vault’s balance.  

No funds are permanently locked, but UX and integrations suffer from unpredictable failures (temporary denial-of-service).

### Mitigation

Add explicit guards before calling the backup vault
