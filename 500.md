# Incorrect fee growth calculation logic will cause users to receive incorrect fee amounts

### Summary

A logic error in the fee growth calculation will cause users to receive incorrect fee amounts as the protocol incorrectly calculates fee growth inside position boundaries, potentially resulting in users receiving more or fewer fees than they are entitled to.

### Root Cause

In [Fees.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Fees.sol#L105-L134), the `getFeeGrowthInside` function has incorrect logic for calculating fee growth inside position boundaries:

```solidity
if (tickCurrent < tickLower) {
    feeGrowthInside0X128 =
        lowerFeeGrowthOutside0X128 -
        upperFeeGrowthOutside0X128;
    feeGrowthInside1X128 =
        lowerFeeGrowthOutside1X128 -
        upperFeeGrowthOutside1X128;
} else if (tickCurrent < tickUpper) {
    feeGrowthInside0X128 =
        feeGrowthGlobal0X128 -
        lowerFeeGrowthOutside0X128 -
        upperFeeGrowthOutside0X128;
    feeGrowthInside1X128 =
        feeGrowthGlobal1X128 -
        lowerFeeGrowthOutside1X128 -
        upperFeeGrowthOutside1X128;
} else {
    feeGrowthInside0X128 =
        upperFeeGrowthOutside0X128 -
        lowerFeeGrowthOutside0X128;
    feeGrowthInside1X128 =
        upperFeeGrowthOutside1X128 -
        lowerFeeGrowthOutside1X128;
}
```

The issue is that this calculation doesn't properly handle the case where the subtraction results in an underflow, which is expected in Uniswap V3's design. In Uniswap's implementation, these calculations are done with unchecked arithmetic to allow underflow, but the protocol needs to properly handle the 2's complement arithmetic.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A position must have its lower or upper tick initialized.
2. The current tick must be outside the position's range (either below the lower tick or above the upper tick).

### External Pre-conditions

None required; this is an internal logic error in the protocol's fee calculation.

### Attack Path

1. User creates a position with specific tick ranges.
2. The pool price moves outside the position's range.
3. Fees accrue while the price is outside the range.
4. When the user claims fees, the incorrect calculation results in an incorrect fee amount.
5. Depending on the specific values, this could result in the user receiving more or fewer fees than they should.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect fee distribution:
- Some users may receive more fees than they are entitled to
- Other users may receive fewer fees than they are entitled to
- The overall accounting of the protocol becomes inconsistent
- In extreme cases, this could lead to significant financial losses for users or the protocol

### PoC

Modify the `getFeeGrowthInside` function to properly handle underflow by using unchecked blocks
