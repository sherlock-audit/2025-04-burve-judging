# Users can have staked LP positions in StationProxy without holding actual tokens

### Summary

When users transfer their Burve ERC20 tokens to another address, the island shares are also removed from the sender and added to the receiver. This is done via the StationProxy, which removes shares on behalf of the sender and adds them on behalf of the destination address. However, due to rounding down, the ERC20 transfer might succeed while the corresponding island share update does not. As a result, a user could end up with non-zero island shares (which the StationProxy never updated) but no ERC20 tokens.



### Root Cause


In `Burve.sol`, within the `_update` function ([lines 713–732](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L713-L732)), the number of island shares to transfer is computed as a ratio of the transferred share amount (`value`) to the sender’s total share balance:

```solidity
uint256 islandTransfer = FullMath.mulDiv(
    islandSharesPerOwner[from],
    value,
    balanceOf(from)
);
```

If the transferred `value` is very small, the result of this operation can round down to zero. This means the ERC20 transfer succeeds, but the corresponding island share transfer does not occur.

Since island share changes must trigger the StationProxy (which handles reward streaming), failing to update it leads to a broken state. A user can repeatedly send small amounts and eventually end up with zero ERC20 balance while still retaining non-zero island shares. In this case, the user remains staked in the StationProxy and continues to earn BGT rewards, despite having no actual ERC20 tokens.

Meanwhile, the recipient of the ERC20 transfer can redeem their share (excluding the island portion), but the reward state remains incorrectly assigned to the sender.


### Internal Pre-conditions

None needed

### External Pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

1. Send such value that the island shares rounds down to 0
2. Repeat


### Impact

Since the destination address can't withdraw the island shares underlying the impact is not high. However, this is clearly a broken functionality so medium.

### PoC

None needed

### Mitigation

```solidity
uint256 islandTransfer = FullMath.mulDiv(
    islandSharesPerOwner[from],
    value,
    balanceOf(from)
);
if (islandTransfer == 0) revert('nope');
```
