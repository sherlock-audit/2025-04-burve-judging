# Swap Chaining May Cause Gas Griefing

### Summary

Lack of gas consumption limits on swap chaining will cause a Denial of Service for users as an attacker will construct long swap paths to consume all gas and revert.

### Root Cause

In [SwapFacet.sol:48-65](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L48-L65) the swap() function allows arbitrary-length swap paths without any limitation or gas optimization.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Attacker calls swap functionality.
- Swap input allows arbitrary length arrays.

### External Pre-conditions

- Gas price must be cheap enough to make grief attacks cheap.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker crafts a swap call chaining thousands of hops.
2. Transaction consumes massive gas.
3. Transaction reverts due to out-of-gas or timeout.
4. Service affected; block space wasted.

### Impact

The protocol suffers throughput reduction; users experience failed transactions.
Attacker loses gas fees, no direct gain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a maximum swap chain depth (e.g., max 5 hops) per transaction.
