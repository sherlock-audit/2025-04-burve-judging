# vault balance descrepency if rewards accumulated in backup vault but withdrawn from active one

### Summary
When trimming balances, the balance is fetched from both active and backup vaults, if backup vault receive more yields than the active one, we are mistakenly withdrawing the yield from active vault.

### Root Cause
in `vertex:trimBalance` function, this is how we fetch the current balance:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L68
```solidity
        //@audit get the realBalance from proxy
        uint256 realBalance = vProxy.balance(cid, false);
        // We don't error and instead emit in this scenario because clearly the vault is not working properly but if
        // we error users can't withdraw funds. Instead the right response is to lock and move vaults immediately.
        if (targetReal > realBalance) {
            emit InsufficientBalance(self.vid, cid, targetReal, realBalance);
            return (0, 0);
        }
```
looking at `vProxy.balance` we see that balance is fetched from both the backup and active vaults:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L213-L221
```solidity
    function balance(
        VaultProxy memory self,
        ClosureId cid,
        bool roundUp
    ) internal view returns (uint128 amount) {
        return
            self.active.balance(cid, roundUp) +
            self.backup.balance(cid, roundUp);
    }
```
that means if the yield is accumulated inside the backup vault, the `balance` function will return that yield:
```solidity
        if (targetReal > realBalance) {
            emit InsufficientBalance(self.vid, cid, targetReal, realBalance);
            return (0, 0);
        }
```
and the `targetReal` will be more than `realBalance`, but when withdrawing the yield (`targetReal - realBalance`) since this yield is most probably less than balance of active vault, we are withdrawing it from active vault:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/Vertex.sol#L75-L76
```solidity
        if (targetReal > realBalance) {
            emit InsufficientBalance(self.vid, cid, targetReal, realBalance);
            return (0, 0);
        }
        uint256 residualReal = realBalance - targetReal;
        vProxy.withdraw(cid, residualReal);
```
when withdrawing, we are first withdrawing from the active vault, then the backup one:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L197-L202
```solidity
        if (amount > available) {
            self.active.withdraw(cid, available);
            self.backup.withdraw(cid, amount - available);
        } else {
            self.active.withdraw(cid, amount);
        }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions
- `targetReal > realBalance`
- `self.backup != address(0)`
- `yield < active_vault_balance`

### External Pre-conditions
_No response_

### Attack Path
_No response_

### Impact
Yield is accumulated in backup vault, but withdrawn from active one, this means the principal amount is withdrawn from and the yield still sits in the backup vault. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

_No response_
