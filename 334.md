# Incorrect calculation order of `assetsToDeposit` and `assetsToWithdraw` in `E4626::commit()` function causes users to withdraw incorrect amounts.

### Summary

Incorrect calculation order of `assetsToDeposit` and `assetsToWithdraw` in `E4626::commit()` function causes users to withdraw incorrect amounts.

### Root Cause

-   In [commit() function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L61-L100) , at line [L71-L73](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L71-L73) , instead of subtracting assetToDeposit from assetToWithdraw and then setting assetToDeposit to 0, the code does the opposite. It sets assetToDeposit to 0 first so that assetToWithdraw does not subtract anything.

    ```solidity
                } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
                assetsToDeposit = 0;
                assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit; // This line subtract nothing
    ```


### Internal Pre-conditions

-   None

### External Pre-conditions

-   None

### Attack Path

-   Every time this function is called with `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`.


### Impact

-   Whenever `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`, this function will trigger the `withdraw()` function from vault with an incorrect `assetsToWithdraw` value. And vault will have to send more assets than necessary.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

-   Subtract assetToDeposit from assetToWithdraw and then set assetToDeposit to 0.

```diff
                } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
-               assetsToDeposit = 0;
-               assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit; // This line subtract nothing
+               assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
+               assetsToDeposit = 0;
```
