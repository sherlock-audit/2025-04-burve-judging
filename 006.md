# Required function is not added for ownership transfer

### Summary

Required function is not added for ownership transfer. It's using two-step ownership transfer but only one side of the function is added to Diamond.

### Root Cause

In [Diamond.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L69), `transferOwnership` function is added to diamond but if we look at the transfer ownership function, it's using two-step ownership transfer method.

```solidity
    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external override {
        AdminLib.reassignOwner(_newOwner);
    }

...

    function reassignOwner(address newOwner) internal {
        validateOwner();
        adminStore().pendingOwner = newOwner;
    }
```

In order to take the ownership, it should call accept ownership function but it's not added to Diamond

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

No, need an attack path

### Impact

Ownership transfer can't be processed successfully in the Diamond.

### Mitigation

Add accept ownership function to Diamond
