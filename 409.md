# Incorrect Tax Deduction and Token Accounting in removeValueSingle

# Incorrect Tax Deduction and Token Accounting in removeValueSingle

### Summary

The `Closure::removeValueSingle` function correctly returns the net token amount (`removedAmount`) after subtracting tax, meaning the user’s actual (nominal) withdrawable token amount. However, when this value is used in `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle`, both `realTax` and `removedBalance` are calculated incorrectly, causing users to lose tokens and breaking the accurate accounting between liquidity providers (LPs) and protocol earnings.


### Root Cause

When we look at `Closure::removeValueSingle`:

```solidity
    function removeValueSingle(
        Closure storage self,
        uint256 value,
        uint256 bgtValue,
        VertexId vid
    ) internal returns (uint256 removedAmount, uint256 tax) {
    ...
        uint256 untaxedRemove = fairVBalance - finalAmount;
        self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);
        tax = FullMath.mulX128(untaxedRemove, self.baseFeeX128, true);
 @>     removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax;
        // This needs to happen last.
        self.valueStaked -= value;
        self.bgtValueStaked -= bgtValue;
}
```

The returned `removedAmount` has already had `tax` subtracted, so the `realRemoved` calculated from it is the actual token amount the user should receive (nominal).

However, When the user calls `ValueFacet::removeValueSingle`, both `realTax` and `removedBalance` are computed incorrectly.

```solidity
        (uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(
            value,
            bgtValue,
            vid
        );   
		uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
        Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);
@>      uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            removedBalance,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );
        c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
@>      removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax; // How much the user actually gets.
        require(removedBalance >= minReceive, PastSlippageBounds());
@>      TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, removedBalance); 
```

The actual token the user should get is simply:

```solidity
realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
```

If you subtract `realTax` again, the user will lose tokens they were supposed to receive. Additionally, the `realTax` calculation is incorrect: it should be directly derived as:

```solidity
realTax = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, nominalTax, false);
```

This miscalculation directly breaks the correct distribution between LPs and protocol earnings.


### Attack Path

When a user calls `removeValueSingle`, the protocol incorrectly:

1.Deducts tax **again** from `realRemoved`, causing the user to lose tokens.

2.Miscalculates `realTax` using a proportional formula instead of directly converting from nominal, which can skew both the user payout and the protocol’s accounting.

These errors compound over time, undermining the balance between liquidity providers’ withdrawals and protocol earnings, effectively misallocating assets and causing silent financial drift.

### Impact

The current implementation leads to token losses for users, misreporting of tax earnings, and disruption of the protocol’s internal balance mechanisms. This directly harms both LP participants and the protocol treasury, as actual distributed earnings and user claims are mismatched.


### Mitigation

The code should be corrected as follows:

```solidity
realTax = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, nominalTax, false);
c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);
Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved + realTax, false);
require(removedBalance >= minReceive, PastSlippageBounds());
TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, realRemoved);
```

This ensures that the user receives the full `realRemoved` amount, while the protocol properly accounts for `realTax`, and the withdraw operation deducts both the user and protocol amounts correctly from the pool.
