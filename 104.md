# User would benefit from pool tokens they never paid for if new token is added to closure

## Summary 
The `removeValue` function removes exactly this much value to the given closure and receive all tokens involved,  It wrap this with a helper contract which validates the received balances are sufficient.
## Vulnerability details
```solidity
function removeValue(
        address recipient,
        uint16 _closureId,
        uint128 value,
        uint128 bgtValue
    )
        external
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory receivedBalances)
    {
        if (value == 0) revert DeMinimisDeposit();
        require(bgtValue <= value, InsufficientValueForBgt(value, bgtValue));
        ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_closureId);
        Closure storage c = Store.closure(cid);
        Store.assets().remove(msg.sender, cid, value, bgtValue);
     @>   uint256[MAX_TOKENS] memory nominalReceives = c.removeValue(
            value,
            bgtValue
        );
        // Send balances
        TokenRegistry storage tokenReg = Store.tokenRegistry();
        for (uint8 i = 0; i < MAX_TOKENS; ++i) {
  @>          if (!cid.contains(i)) continue;
            address token = tokenReg.tokens[i];
            uint256 realSend = AdjustorLib.toReal(
                token,
                nominalReceives[i],
                false
            );
            receivedBalances[i] = realSend;
            // Users can remove value even if the token is locked. It actually helps derisk us.
            Store.vertex(VertexLib.newId(i)).withdraw(cid, realSend, false);
            TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, recipient, realSend);
        }
```
As we can in the pointer it first of all converts the value to withdraw to nominal value, then iterates over all the tokens checking for token in the Cid , However if a new token is added to the closure id the user would withdraw value from this token.

## Attack Path
1. A pool is created with 8 tokens in total
2. Bob decides to add value for 8 tokens with 100$ each
3. Closure owner decides to add two tokens
4. When bob tries to withdraw his value he would get 1000$(10 * 100) instead 800$ + fees
## Impact
steal value from closure tokens without adding value to it
## Recommended Mitigation
Ensure user only gets value for token he added value for
