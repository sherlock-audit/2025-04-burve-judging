# Lack of Slippage Protection in Burve Mint/Burn

### Summary

The absence of explicit slippage protection in the mint and burn functions can cause users to receive fewer tokens than expected (on burn) or provide more tokens than intended (on mint), as the contract only enforces price range checks but not minimum/maximum token amounts. This exposes liquidity providers and removers to unexpected losses if pool state changes between transaction submission and execution.

### Root Cause

In [Burve.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L350-L351), the `mint` and `burn` functions use the `withinSqrtPX96Limits` modifier to ensure the pool price is within a user-specified range. However, neither function allows users to specify `minAmountOut` or `maxAmountIn` parameters to protect against slippage in the actual token amounts received or provided. The token amounts are calculated at execution time based on the current pool state, which may differ from user expectations if the price moves or if rounding/fee effects occur.


### Internal Pre-conditions

- User submits a mint or burn transaction with expected token amounts based on current pool state.
- The pool price and/or liquidity changes between transaction submission and execution (e.g., due to MEV, front-running, or normal trading activity).

### External Pre-conditions

- The underlying Uniswap V3 pool or external state changes, affecting price or liquidity.
- Network congestion or delays increase the likelihood of state changes between transaction submission and mining.

### Attack Path

- User submits a `mint` or `burn` transaction expecting specific token amounts.
- An attacker or normal market activity moves the pool price (within the allowed range) before the transaction is mined.
- The transaction executes, but the actual token amounts provided/received differ from user expectations.
- The user receives fewer tokens (burn) or provides more tokens (mint) than intended, suffering slippage.

### Impact

Liquidity providers and removers are exposed to slippage beyond their intended tolerance. This can result in:

- Users receiving fewer tokens than expected when burning LP tokens.
- Users providing more tokens than expected when minting LP tokens.
- Increased risk of MEV and front-running attacks that exploit this lack of protection.
- Reduced user trust and adoption due to unpredictable outcomes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add explicit slippage protection parameters to the `mint` and `burn` functions, such as `minAmountOut` (for burn) and `maxAmountIn` (for mint). These should revert the transaction if the actual token amounts differ from user expectations.
