# Loss of Funds Due to Incorrect Handling of Rebasing Tokens


## Summary
The DecimalAdjustor contract fails to properly account for rebasing tokens, leading to loss of funds for users. When tokens rebase while held by the protocol, the increased token balance is not reflected in the nominal value stored by the protocol. As a result, users can only withdraw their original deposit amount, effectively losing all rebased tokens.

## Vulnerability Details
The protocol explicitly states it supports rebasing tokens in the contest details:
> "We allow for: rebasing tokens, missing return values, flash mintable, approval race protected, decimals >=6 and <=18"

However, the DecimalAdjustor contract (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/DecimalAdjustor.sol#L27-L112) fails to properly account for rebasing events. The vulnerability is in the core implementation of how the adjustor handles token conversions:

1. When a token is first added, the adjustor caches its adjustment factor in the `cacheAdjustment` function
2. This adjustment factor remains static and doesn't update when rebasing events occur
3. The `toNominal` and `toReal` functions use this static adjustment factor for all conversions

This flawed implementation leads to:
1. Loss of funds for users when they withdraw after a rebase occurs
2. Compounding losses with multiple rebases
3. Violation of the invariant that "No closure can send out more tokens than its recorded balance" (since the actual balance increases but the recorded nominal value doesn't)

When a rebasing token increases its balance while held by the protocol, the protocol's internal accounting (nominal value) remains unchanged. When a user withdraws, they only receive the original amount they deposited, not including any rebased tokens. These rebased tokens remain trapped in the protocol and cannot be withdrawn by any user.

## Impact
This vulnerability directly causes loss of funds for users of rebasing tokens. The impact compounds over time:

1. With a single 5% rebase, users lose approximately 4.76% of their funds
2. With multiple rebases, the losses compound (e.g., 9.29% loss after two 5% rebases)
3. For popular rebasing tokens like stETH (which has a ~3-4% annual yield), users would lose their entire staking yield over the course of a year

This is particularly severe because:
- The protocol explicitly claims to support rebasing tokens
- The losses compound over time, affecting long-term users more severely
- Popular rebasing tokens like stETH are likely to be used with the protocol

## Proof of Concept
The vulnerability exists in the DecimalAdjustor contract implementation, which fails to account for rebasing tokens properly. The core issue is that the contract doesn't update its internal accounting when rebasing events occur.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, add the following test to the DecimalAdjustor test file located at `test/integrations/adjustor/DecimalAdjustor.t.sol`:

```solidity

    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol, uint8 decimals_) MockERC20(name, symbol, decimals_) {}

    /**
     * @dev Simulates a rebasing event by minting tokens to all holders proportionally
     * @param holder The address holding tokens that will receive the rebase
     * @param rebasePercent The percentage to increase balances by (e.g., 5 for 5%)
     */
    function rebase(address holder, uint256 rebasePercent) external {
        uint256 currentBalance = balanceOf(holder);
        uint256 rebaseAmount = (currentBalance * rebasePercent) / 100;
        _mint(holder, rebaseAmount);
    }
}

## Recommended Mitigation
There are several possible approaches to fix this issue in the DecimalAdjustor contract:

1. **Track rebasing events**: Modify the DecimalAdjustor contract to detect and account for rebasing events:
   ```solidity
   // Add a function to update the adjustment factor based on actual token balances
   function updateAdjustmentForRebase(address token) public {
       uint256 expectedBalance = _expectedBalances[token];
       uint256 actualBalance = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));

       if (actualBalance > expectedBalance && expectedBalance > 0) {
           // A rebase has occurred, update the adjustment factor
           uint256 rebaseFactor = (actualBalance * 1e18) / expectedBalance;
           _adjustments[token] = (_adjustments[token] * rebaseFactor) / 1e18;
           _expectedBalances[token] = actualBalance;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Use share-based accounting**: Refactor the DecimalAdjustor to track shares of the total pool instead of token amounts:
   ```solidity
   // Track shares instead of token amounts
   mapping(address => uint256) private _userShares;
   mapping(address => uint256) private _totalShares;

   function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) public returns (uint256 shares) {
       uint256 totalTokens = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
       uint256 totalSharesForToken = _totalShares[token];

       // Calculate shares based on current token balance
       if (totalSharesForToken == 0) {
           shares = amount;
       } else {
           shares = (amount * totalSharesForToken) / totalTokens;
       }

       _userShares[msg.sender] += shares;
       _totalShares[token] += shares;
   }
   ```

3. **Wrapper tokens**: Create non-rebasing wrapper tokens for rebasing tokens, similar to how Curve handles rebasing tokens with their implementation of wstETH.

4. **Explicit rebasing support**: Add a specific flag for rebasing tokens and handle them differently:
   ```solidity
   mapping(address => bool) private _isRebasingToken;

   function setRebasingToken(address token, bool isRebasing) external onlyOwner {
       _isRebasingToken[token] = isRebasing;
   }

   function toNominal(address token, uint256 amount, bool roundUp) public view override returns (uint256) {
       if (_isRebasingToken[token]) {
           // For rebasing tokens, get the current balance and calculate the adjustment dynamically
           // ...
       } else {
           // Use the existing static adjustment for non-rebasing tokens
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

The most straightforward approach would be to implement option 1 or 2, as they require minimal changes to the existing architecture while properly accounting for rebasing tokens.
