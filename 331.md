# Double Fee Deduction in `removeValueSingle` Function

### Summary

The `removeValueSingle` function deducts trading fees twice due to overlapping tax logic between the `Closure` library and the `ValueFacet` contract. The `Closure.removeValueSingle(...)` function already subtracts the fee from the returned `removedAmount`. However, in `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle(...)`, an additional fee is computed and deducted from the final balance based on the same tax value. As a result, liquidity providers are overcharged during single-token withdrawals.



### Root Cause

The miscalculation arises from a misunderstanding of how the `tax` and `removedAmount` are handled across layers:

In [Closure.removeValueSingle(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L288):

```solidity
removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax; // fee is already subtracted here
```

So `removedAmount` is **net of tax**.

But in `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle(...)`, the code redundantly subtracts tax again:

```solidity
(uint256 removedNominal, uint256 nominalTax) = c.removeValueSingle(...);
...
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
...
removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax; // @audit: fee removed again
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

No need

### External Pre-conditions

No need

### Attack Path

Any removeValueSingle call will deduct double fee

### Impact

This leads to:

* First fee taken when computing `removedAmount` in the closure.
* Second fee taken again in the facet after converting nominal to real value.

The protocol therefore charges **twice the intended base fee** on single-token liquidity removals, reducing user payout unfairly and breaking accounting expectations.


### Mitigation

Do not remove tax in closure processing
