# Division-by-Zero on Empty Pool making queryTVL() unusable

### Title
Division-by-Zero on Empty Pool making queryTVL() unusable

### Severity
•	Impact: Medium (Denial of Service for on-chain and off-chain queries; breaks front-ends relying on queryTVL).
•	Likelihood: High (occurs whenever the pool is freshly deployed and no shares exist).

### Difficulty
Medium

### Type


### Target
src/single/Burve.sol

## Description
The `queryTVL()` function immediately calls
```solidity
(query0, query1) = queryValueV3Ranges(totalShares);
```
and then adds the island portion. Internally, `queryValueV3Ranges` uses
```solidity
FullMath.mulDiv(shares, uint256(totalNominalLiq), totalShares)
```
to allocate accumulated fees pro-rata. If `totalShares == 0` (i.e. immediately after deployment, before any mint), this results in division by zero and a revert—making `queryTVL()` unusable on an otherwise healthy pool.

## Exploit Scenario
	1.	Deploy the Burve contract with zero initial liquidity.
	2.	Call queryTVL() from any EOA or UI.
	3.	The transaction reverts due to a division-by-zero in FullMath.mulDiv(..., totalShares).
	4.	No one can read the TVL until at least one share has been minted, potentially breaking monitoring dashboards or downstream logic.

## Recommendations
Guard against zero shares before performing any pro-rata math. For example, at the top of `queryValueV3Ranges` modify check to:
```solidity
        if (shares == 0 || totalShares == 0) {
            return (0, 0);
        }
```
