# Missing deadline parameter can lead to loss of funds

## Vulnerability Details 
The functions SwapFacet.swap, `ValueFacet.addValueSingle`, `ValueFacet.addSingleForValue`, `ValueFacet.removeSingleForValue` and `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle` have slippage protections by enforcing `minOut/maxIn` amounts, but lack the **deadline parameter**. 

i.e:  [swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L52-L146) function
```solidity
    function swap(
        address recipient,
        address inToken,
        address outToken,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint256 amountLimit,
        uint16 _cid
    ) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount) {
          // @audit-issue missing deadline
         // slipagge is enforced through `amountLimit` but there's no deadline 
        // to limit when the transaction will be executed
    } 
```

This parameter can provide the user an option to limit the execution of their pending transaction.
Without a deadline parameter, users can execute their transactions at unexpected times when market conditions are unfavorable.

## Impact
- User has no control over when the transaction will be executed, exposing them to undesired market volatility and potential loss of funds. 

## Recommendation
Introduce a `deadline` parameter in all functions mentioned above. Revert if the current timestamp is greater than the deadline.
