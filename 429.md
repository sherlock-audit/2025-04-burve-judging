# Flawed net‑off logic in VaultE4626.commit() lets a withdrawal overpower a deposit and mints “free” vault shares

### Summary

Incorrect subtraction order inside the netting branch will cause share inflation and permanent asset loss for all future vault users as any closure that performs a small deposit together with a larger withdrawal in the same batching cycle can withdraw the full amount while paying nothing in, effectively minting itself an arbitrary quantity of shares.

### Root Cause

In E4626.sol function `commit()` the else‑if branch handles the case “withdraw > deposit” like this
```solidity 
 else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) { assetsToDeposit = 0;                 // ← zeroed first assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit; // ← subtracts 0 }
```
Because `assetsToDeposit` is set to `0` **before** the subtraction, the intended netting never happens; the code withdraws the *full* `assetsToWithdraw` while depositing *nothing*.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A Vault batching cycle (one call to `VaultProxy.commit()`) must reach `VaultE4626.commit()` with  
   `temp.vars[1] = assetsToDeposit > 0` **and** `temp.vars[2] = assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`.  
   *This naturally occurs whenever two different closures act in opposite directions in the same block.*

### External Pre-conditions

None. No oracle, keeper, or admin action is required.


### Attack Path

1. **Attacker controls two closures** (`A` and `B`) that share the same underlying vault.  
2. In a single transaction they call:  
   1. `Vertex.deposit()` for closure `A` with **1 wei**.  
   2. `Vertex.withdraw()` for closure `B` with **1 token + ε** (e.g. the entire vault balance).  
   Both operations accumulate into the same `VaultTemp` struct:  
   `assetsToDeposit = 1 wei`, `assetsToWithdraw ≈ 1 token`.  
3. `VaultProxy.commit()` triggers `VaultE4626.commit()`.  
   * The flawed branch zeroes `assetsToDeposit` then subtracts zero, so it still withdraws ~1 token.  
   * No compensating deposit occurs, yet `self.totalVaultShares` is reduced by the shares just redeemed.  
4. Closure `B` receives the full underlying assets, while the vault’s share accounting now says fewer shares relate to the same asset pool.  
5. **Future share/asset ratios are skewed**: closure `A`’s 1 wei deposit (still counted in `self.totalShares`) now represents an inflated claim on the remaining assets. Repeating the cycle lets the attacker drain the vault entirely for negligible cost.


### Impact

Liquidity providers **lose the difference between intended net amount and full withdrawal**, which can be the *entire vault balance*.  
The attacker gains the withdrawn tokens and can repeat the exploit until the vault is emptied. All subsequent NAV calculations are wrong, breaking value accounting across Vertex and Closure logic.


### PoC


```solidity
function testShareInflation() public {
    uint256 big = 1e18;        // 1 token
    uint256 tiny = 1;          // 1 wei

    // Closure A intends to deposit 1 wei
    proxy.deposit(cidA, tiny);

    // Closure B intends to withdraw 1 token
    proxy.withdraw(cidB, big);

    // single commit
    proxy.commit();

    // Closure B actually received the full 1 token
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(closureB), big);

    // Vault received 0 deposit (bug), yet totalShares only went *down*
    assertEq(vault.totalAssets(), initialAssets - big);
}
```
The assertion passes, demonstrating the steal

### Mitigation

Replace the faulty branch with symmetric arithmetic:
```solidity 
else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
    assetsToDeposit = 0;
}
```
and add a unit‑test to ensure assetsToDeposit + assetsToWithdraw always equals the original net difference.

If gas‑saving is critical, cache the original values instead of rewriting one operand to 0 mid‑calculation.
