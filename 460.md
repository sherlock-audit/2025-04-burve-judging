# Incorrect use of the `removedNominal` variable causes users to pay the tax twice

### Summary

Incorrect use of the `removedNominal` variable in `removeValueSingle()` function causes users to pay the tax twice.

### Root Cause

In [`ValueFacet.sol:228`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L228) the closure's `removeValueSingle()` function returns the `removedNominal` value, representing the token amount after tax deduction.
In [`ValueFacet.sol:243`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L243) the user receives an amount called `removedBalance`, calculated by converting `removedNominal` into `realRemoved` and deducting the tax once again.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin sets `baseFeeX128` to be greater than 0.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User calls `removeValueSingle` function.

### Impact

Users have to pay tax twice when they call `removeValueSingle` function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Withdraw a total amount of `realRemoved + realTax` from the vertex.
- Transfer the amount `realRemoved` to the user.
