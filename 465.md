# Closures are not compatible with rebasing tokens

## Summary
Rebasing tokens can create problems for contracts that assume token balances remain static. Although the README states that rebasing tokens are in scope, the current codebase is not compatible with them.

### Root Cause

Rebasing tokens might not be fully compatible with the system, and here is why:

**1- Transfers can deliver slightly less than requested (even without explicit fees).**
Closure assumes that each vertex receives the exact amount requested. In `closure::addValue`, balances are first increased by `requiredBalances[i];` later, `ValueFacet::addValue` transfers the same `requiredBalances[i]` from the user to the contract:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L136-L142
```solidity
            requiredBalances[i] = FullMath.mulX128(
                scaleX128,
                self.balances[i],
                true
            );
            self.setBalance(i, self.balances[i] + requiredBalances[i]);
```
rebase tokens (notably stETH) send 1–2 wei less than specified due to rounding adjustments.
`https://docs.lido.fi/guides/lido-tokens-integration-guide/#1-2-wei-corner-case`
As a result, `closure.balances` may overstate the actual tokens held, leading to discrepancies when users withdraw.

**2- Negative and positive rebases**
During a rebase (positive or negative), the contract’s stored balance no longer matches the token’s real balance:
`closure.balances[rebaing_token_vid] != rebasing_token.balanceOf(rebasing_token_vault);`
Thus, closures fail to track a rebasing token’s balance accurately.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Closure contains a rebase token

### External Pre-conditions

- A positive or negative rebase happen for the token

### Attack Path

### Impact

Incorrect accounting of rebasing token balances, as these tokens have an elastic supply and balances also change accordingly, but closures fail to sync their internal accounting of this tokens.
This could have various impacts:

**1- Adding/Removing single values resulting in incorrect value gap for the rebase token (`valueSumX128`), as the self.balances[rebase_token] might not reflect actual balance:**

**2- Adding/removing tokens for values resulting in incorrect "T", because the new "T" is calculated using an stale balance of the rebase token:**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L318-L323
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L361-L366

**3- When users request withdraw, lets say through `ValueFacet::removeValue`, the returned amount of tokens to be withdrawn are wrong for the rebase token:**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L236-L241
this might result in users burning value but receiving less tokens if a rebase happened

**4- another impact could be `vertex::trimBalance` reporting an incorrect amount of yield, where balance of the rebase token increases but not due to actual yield**

### PoC

### Mitigation

For rebasing tokens, either:
- Track real balances and listen for rebase events to keep internal state in sync, or
- Exclude rebasing tokens entirely, since any rebase can render “T” and other accounting variables stale.
