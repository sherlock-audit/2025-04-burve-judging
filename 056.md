# Incorrect usage of storage for Diamond Proxy

### Summary

Here's the code snippet of current storage layout of the diamond proxy:

```solidity
struct Storage {
    AssetBook assets;
    TokenRegistry tokenReg;
    VaultStorage _vaults;
    Simplex simplex;
    Locker _locker;
    Reserve _reserve;
    // Graph elements
    mapping(ClosureId => Closure) closures;
    mapping(VertexId => Vertex) vertices;
}
```

As in the implementation, there is one storage struct that includes storage of all facets.
The most important part of using diamond proxy is extensibility of the protocol by separating facets into different contracts.

However, with current implementation, none of the facets can be updated because adding a storage slot to the a facet's storage will cause the collision of the storage.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue comes from incorporating all facets' storage into one struct, in [Store.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Store.sol#L16-L26).

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol tries to extend the functionality of the protocol by adding new storage slots to one of the facets storage, for example in `VaultFacet`.


### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions are required for this issue.

### Attack Path

The attack path is straightforward, when a new storage slot is added to a facet, the storage collision will happen.

### Impact

The extensibility of the diamond proxy architecture is broken and the protocol will not be able to add new storage slots to the facets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should separate the storage of the facets into different locations so that facets' storage does not collide with each other.

Refer to [LiFi](https://github.com/lifinance/contracts) smart contracts as an example storage definition in diamond proxy architecture.
