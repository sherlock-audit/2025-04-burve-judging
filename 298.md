# Incorrect netting logic in `commit()` function leads to wrong withdrawals

### Summary

 The commit function in the `E4626.sol` file at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L62-78  contains a logical bug within its netting mechanism for simultaneous deposits and withdrawals. When the withdrawal amount exceeds the deposit amount, the code incorrectly prevents the deposit amount from being subtracted from the withdrawal, resulting in a wrong withdrawal operation.

### Root Cause

The logical error resides within the `else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit)` block of the initial netting logic. The `assetsToDeposit` variable is prematurely set to 0 before its value is subtracted from `assetsToWithdraw`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

The `commit()` function must be called with `temp.vars[1]` (representing `assetsToDeposit`) and `temp.vars[2]` (representing `assetsToWithdraw`) both being greater than zero, and `assetsToWithdraw` being strictly greater than `assetsToDeposit`.

### Attack Path

1. Assume a scenario where `temp.vars[1]` ( `assetsToDeposit`) is set to a positive value (e.g., `10e18`).
2. Assume a scenario where `temp.vars[2]` (`assetsToWithdraw`) is set to a positive value greater than assetsToDeposit (e.g., `20e18`).
3. Call the commit function with these values.
4. Observe the value of `assetsToWithdraw` after the else if block. It will remain `20e18` instead of being reduced to `10e18`.
5. The subsequent withdrawal from the vault will be for `20e18` instead of being reduced to `10e18`.

### Impact

Wrong amount being withdrawn if `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit)` block in the commit function as follows:

```solidity
        } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
            assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
            assetsToDeposit = 0;
        }
```

This ensures that the `assetsToDeposit` amount is correctly subtracted from `assetsToWithdraw` before `assetsToDeposit` is set to zero.
