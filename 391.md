# Missing owner acceptance function will prevent ownership transfer completion


## Summary
The absence of an acceptOwnership function in the Diamond contract prevents proper ownership transfer, as potential owners cannot accept transferred ownership, leaving the contract in a pending ownership state.

## Root Cause
The AdminLib implements a two-step ownership transfer pattern, but the Diamond contract lacks the function selector for acceptOwnership, preventing the second step from being executed.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L68C12-L76C16

```solidity
    bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](3);
    adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
    adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
    adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;

    // Missing function selector for acceptOwnership
    // bytes4(keccak256("acceptOwnership()"))
```

## Pre-conditions
Internal Pre-conditions

1. Current owner needs to call transferOwnership(address) to initiate ownership transfer
2. Diamond contract must be deployed and initialized
3. Admin storage slot must be properly set up

## Attack Path
1. Current owner calls transferOwnership(newOwner)
2. New owner attempts to accept ownership but cannot due to missing function selector
3. Contract remains in pending ownership transfer state indefinitely

## Impact
The protocol cannot complete ownership transfers, which:

1. Prevents proper administrative handovers
2. May lock contract in current ownership state
3. Forces redeployment if ownership transfer is critical

Proof of Concept
```solidity
  function testCanAdminLib() public {

        BaseAdminFacet _baseAdmin = BaseAdminFacet(diamond);

        vm.startPrank(owner);
        assertEq(_baseAdmin.owner(), owner);
        
        address newOwner = makeAddr("newOwner");
        _baseAdmin.transferOwnership(newOwner);

        vm.startPrank(newOwner);
        //Fails with FunctionNotFound(0x79ba5097) as the acceptOwnership function is not part of the function selectors configured in the diamond
        _baseAdmin.acceptOwnership();

        assertEq(_baseAdmin.owner(), newOwner);

    }
```


## Mitigation
Add the acceptOwnership function selector to the Diamond contract:

```diff
    bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](3);
    adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
    adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
    adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;

+   bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](4);
+   adminSelectors[3] = BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership.selector;
```
