# the function  addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl) will revert due to underflow when self.balances[valIter.vIdx] is subtracted from fairVBalance i.e  fairVBalance - self.balances[valIter.vIdx].

### Summary

when the function  addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl) is called,  the function iterSingleValueDiff returns wrong/incorrect fairVBalance, as a result   function  addValueSingle will revert due to underflow when self.balances[valIter.vIdx] is subtracted from fairVBalance i.e  fairVBalance - self.balances[valIter.vIdx] which is explained below .

Similarly, when the function removeValueSingle(library ClosureImpl) is called, the function iterSingleValueDiff returns wrong/incorrect fairVBalance, so function removeValueSingle’s accounting mechanism will be broken.


### Root Cause

the function iterSingleValueDiff returns wrong/incorrect fairVBalance in the function  addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl).

### Internal Pre-conditions

when fairVBalance is less than  self.balances[valIter.vIdx] i.e when  value(function addValueSingle’s input) is less than self.n * self.targetX128, then the addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl) will revert due to underflow.


### External Pre-conditions

there is no external pre conditions.

### Attack Path

1. Let’s assume, a closure is added with cid 1 and startingTarget 5 by calling the function addClosure(SimplexFacet.sol) which calls Closure’s init function i.e c.init with cid 1 and startingTarget 5. Assume, this closureid has 5 tokens(number of tokens in this closure).

2. Now See function init(library ClosureImpl) where cid 1 and target(startingTarget) 5 , so self.targetX128 is set to 5 and  self.valueStaked =  target * self.n = 5*5 = 25, self.balances[vIter.idx()] is set to 5 for every token’s VertexId.

3. Afterthat, function addValueSingle(ValueFacet.sol) for this closure  is called with value 1 and with the 1st token(1st token of this closure) which calls closure’s  function addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl) with value 1.

4. Now see function addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl) where scaleX128 = value/ (self.n * self.targetX128) = 1/(5*5) = 1/25 = 0.04, now SingleValueIter’s(valIter) scaleX128 is set to 0.04, vIdx is set to 1st token vid/vertex, now iterSingleValueDiff(self, valIter, true) is called where fairBalance for the 1st token is   valIter.scaleX128* self.balances[i] = 0.04*5 = 0.2, as   (i == valIter.vIdx) for the 1st token, so  vertexBalance = fairBalance = 0.2, 

5. So  vertexBalance i.e 0.2 is returned  from iterSingleValueDiff in addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl),   here  fairVBalance = 0.2 , afterthat  requiredAmount is calculated i.e  fairVBalance - self.balances[valIter.vIdx] = 0.2 - 5  which will revert due to underflow.

### Impact

the function  addValueSingle(library ClosureImpl) will revert due to underflow when self.balances[valIter.vIdx] is subtracted from fairVBalance i.e  fairVBalance - self.balances[valIter.vIdx]. 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

correct the fairVBalance calculation in the function iterSingleValueDiff.
