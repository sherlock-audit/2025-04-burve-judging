# Manager Fee Applied to User-Owned Unclaimed Rewards

### Title
Manager Fee Applied to User-Owned Unclaimed Rewards

### Severity
Impact: Medium–High.
	•	Causes permanent underpayment of BLP LP positions when querying or claiming island fees.
	•	Users never see nor receive the full portion of their historical tokensOwed.
Likelihood: Medium.
	•	Any pool with a nonzero manager-fee basis points and pending tokensOwed will miscalculate fee shares.

### Difficulty
Medium

### Type


### Target
src/single/Burve.sol

## Description
In `queryValueIsland` (and similarly in the on-chain fee-claim path), the code sums both the `newly accumulated fees` and the `historical tokensOwed` for a user, then applies the manager-fee percentage to that total:
```solidity
fees0 += tokensOwed0;
fees1 += tokensOwed1;

// subtract manager fee
(fees0, fees1) = subtractManagerFee(
    fees0,
    fees1,
    island.managerFeeBPS()
);
```
Because `tokensOwed` represents already earned but unclaimed user fees, charging the manager fee on that amount effectively steals from user-owned balances. The manager should only take a cut of `newly accumulated fees`, not of what’s already owed to users.


## Exploit Scenario
	1.	User A earns some fees & has tokensOwed0 = 100.
	2.	Manager Fee is set to 10% (1000 bps).
	3.	When queryValueIsland runs, it does:
	•	accFees0 = viewAccumulatedFees(...) → say 50.
	•	fees0 = accFees0 + tokensOwed0 = 50 + 100 = 150
	•	fees0 = 150 – 10% = 135
	4.	User A ends up seeing/receiving only 135 tokens out of the 150 they were due—manager improperly skimmed 10 tokens of A’s historical tokensOwed.

## Recommendations
Only subtract the manager fee from the newly accumulated fees, then add the user’s historic tokensOwed back in full:
```solidity
-    fees0 += tokensOwed0;
-    fees1 += tokensOwed1;
-
-    // subtract manager fee from total
-    (fees0, fees1) = subtractManagerFee(fees0, fees1, island.managerFeeBPS());

+    // get only the newly accumulated fees
+    (uint256 accFees0, uint256 accFees1) = FeeLib.viewAccumulatedFees(
+        pool, lower, upper, tick, liquidity,
+        feeGrowthInside0LastX128, feeGrowthInside1LastX128
+    );
+    // manager takes fee only on new fees
+    (accFees0, accFees1) = subtractManagerFee(
+        accFees0, accFees1, island.managerFeeBPS()
+    );
+    // now add back the user’s already-owed tokens in full
+    fees0 = accFees0 + tokensOwed0;
+    fees1 = accFees1 + tokensOwed1;
```
This ensures the manager only skims from newly generated island fees, and never from the user’s historical unclaimed balance.
