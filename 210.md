# Missing validation in VaultLib.transfer allows cross-token transfers

### Summary

The missing validation in [`VaultLib.transfer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/VaultFacet.sol#L72) will cause potential loss of funds for users as protocol admins can accidentally transfer tokens between vaults for different tokens, leading to accounting errors and protocol insolvency

### Root Cause

In [`VaultProxy.sol:98-110`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/VaultProxy.sol#L98-L110) there is a missing validation that both vaults in the transfer function are for the same token, despite the comment stating 'This implicitly requires that the two vaults are based on the same token'

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol needs to have at least two different tokens with active vaults2. Admin needs to have permission to call the `transferBalance` function
3. At least one vault needs to have a non-zero token balance

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Admin calls `transferBalance` with `fromVault` being a vault for token A and `toVault` being a vault for token B**
2. **The `VaultLib.transfer` function doesn't validate that both vaults are for the same token**
3. **The function proceeds to withdraw token A from the first vault**
4. **It then attempts to deposit token A into the second vault, which is meant for token B**
5. **This creates an accounting mismatch where token A is now in a vault meant for token B**
6. **The protocol's accounting system now has incorrect balances, potentially leading to insolvency**

### Impact

The protocol and its users suffer potential loss of funds equal to the amount transferred between incompatible vaults. This could lead to:
        
1. Accounting errors where the protocol thinks it has more of token B than it actually does
2. Users being unable to withdraw their tokens because they're in the wrong vault
3. Protocol insolvency if large amounts are transferred incorrectly
4. Loss of user funds if the protocol cannot honor withdrawals due to accounting errors

### Mitigation

 Add explicit validation in the `VaultLib.transfer` function to ensure both vaults are for the same token:

```solidity
        function transfer(
            address fromVault,
            address toVault,
            ClosureId cid,
            uint256 amount
        ) internal {
            VaultStorage storage vStore = Store.vaults();
            
            // Add validation that both vaults are for the same token
            VertexId fromVid = vStore.usedBy[fromVault];
            VertexId toVid = vStore.usedBy[toVault];
            require(VertexId.unwrap(fromVid) == VertexId.unwrap(toVid), "Vaults must be for the same token");
            
            // Prevent self-transfers (optional optimization)
            require(fromVault != toVault, "Cannot transfer to the same vault");
            
            VaultPointer memory from = getVault(fromVault);
            from.withdraw(cid, amount);
            from.commit();
            VaultPointer memory to = getVault(toVault);
            to.deposit(cid, amount);
            to.commit();
        }
```

This fix ensures that tokens can only be transferred between vaults for the same token, maintaining the protocol's accounting integrity.
