# Incorrect BGT Accounting in `exchange()`

high 

### Summary

The `exchange()` function updates `bgtBalance` by subtracting the BGT amount owed to the caller before the caller actually withdraws the tokens via the `withdraw()` function. This creates a mismatch between the internal accounting and the actual token balance held by the contract, which can lead to under-accounting of available BGT tokens, lost funds, or denial of service due to perceived insufficient balance.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L39` the `bgtBalance` is decremented inside the `exchange()` function immediately after computing the amount of BGT to be owed. However, the actual transfer of BGT tokens to the user is deferred to the `withdraw()` function, which is invoked separately. This premature deduction desynchronizes the internal `bgtBalance` from the actual BGT token balance held by the contract.
```solidity
if (bgtAmount > 0) {
    bgtBalance -= bgtAmount; // Accounting change happens here
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(...); // But tokens are not sent yet
    owed[msg.sender] += bgtAmount;
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

- `msg.sender` must be in the `isExchanger` mapping.

- `rate[inToken] > 0` must result in `bgtAmount > 0` during the exchange.

- `bgtBalance >= bgtAmount` at the time of exchange.

### External Pre-conditions

- The contract must be funded with BGT tokens via the `fund()` function.

- An authorized user initiates `exchange()` but does not call `withdraw()` afterward.



### Attack Path

1. A malicious or inattentive exchanger repeatedly calls `exchange()` for valid token input.

2. Each call deducts `bgtBalance` and increases their `owed` amount.

3. However, they never call `withdraw()`, meaning actual BGT tokens remain in the contract.

4. Over time, `bgtBalance` becomes artificially reduced, despite the contract still holding the BGT tokens.

5. This leads to future exchanges being rejected due to perceived insufficient `bgtBalance`, resulting in a denial of service.

6. Conversely, if admin later forcibly transfers tokens using `sendBalance()`, user withdrawals may permanently fail, since internal accounting treats those funds as already spent.

### Impact

- Denial of Service: Legitimate exchangers may be unable to convert tokens if `bgtBalance` appears depleted.

- Fund Mismanagement: Actual BGT token holdings and internal accounting can diverge.

- Loss of Trust: Users may not receive tokens they are shown as "owed" due to forced transfers or mismanagement.

- Potential Stuck Funds: If owed tokens are never withdrawn, they become "ghost funds" â€” counted as gone but still locked in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Move the line `bgtBalance -= bgtAmount`; from `exchange()` to `withdraw()` so that the balance is only decremented after tokens are actually transferred.
