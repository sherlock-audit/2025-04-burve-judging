# H[02]-Double-Charging of Tax in `removeValueSingle`

## Summary
The `removeValueSingle` function in the main contract double-charges tax due to incorrect ordering of tax computation and balance finalization. The tax is already deducted within the inner Closure.`removeValueSingle` function, yet another `realTax` is subtracted externally again in the outer function. This results in users receiving less than expected and incorrect value transfer.

Note: I'm reporting this issue assuming that the other realTax issues i submitted has been resolved

## Vulnerability Details

Let’s trace how tax is applied twice:

## 1. Inside the internal closure logic
```solidity
removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax; // tax already deducted here
```

So `removedAmount` already reflects the net value the user is supposed to receive after tax.


## 2. Back in the `ValueFacet` function `removeValueSingle`

```solidity
    uint256 realRemoved = AdjustorLib.toReal(token, removedNominal, false);
    Store.vertex(vid).withdraw(cid, realRemoved, false);

    uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
        removedBalance, // initially zero here; assuming bug is fixed
        nominalTax,
        removedNominal
    );

    // ❌ Net amount reduced again
    removedBalance = realRemoved - realTax;
```

Here, tax is calculated again on `realRemoved`, which already reflects the tax-deducted value, leading to double taxation.

## Impact
User receives less than expected: The actual `removedBalance` transferred is smaller than the fair `post-tax` amount.

## Recommendation 
Move tax handling entirely to the outer function for clarity and correctness.
In `Closure.removeValueSingle`, remove the subtraction:

```solidity
- removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax;
+ removedAmount += untaxedRemove; // Tax is not subtracted here
```
