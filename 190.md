# Burve E4626ViewAdjustor Unchecked convertToAssets() Call Allows In-Transaction ERC-4626 Rate Manipulation and Asset Theft

## Brief

The [E4626ViewAdjustor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/adjustor/E4626ViewAdjustor.sol#L51) performs share-to-asset conversions for any ERC-4626 vault by calling the vault’s `convertToAssets()` view.

Because the adaptor (a) performs no rate-stability or sanity checks, (b) ignores the rounding flag that the rest of the system relies on, and (c) is invoked between two state-changing phases of complex operations (e.g., swaps, single-sided deposits / withdrawals), an attacker can externally distort an 4626 vault’s exchange-rate during the same transaction and force Burve to settle at that manipulated price.

A single-tx donation / withdraw (or any negative-rebase event) lets the attacker obtain or withdraw far more underlying value than intended, ultimately draining assets from liquidity providers and, in extreme cases, pushing the system into an under-collateralised state.

## Details

### 1. Vulnerable conversion logic

`E4626ViewAdjustor.toReal()` simply forwards the request to the vault:

```solidity
function toReal(address token, uint256 nominal, bool)
        external view returns (uint256 real)
{
    IERC4626 vault = getVault(token);           // only checks vault.asset() match
    return vault.convertToAssets(nominal);      // blind passthrough
}

```

- No upper / lower rate bounds, no caching, no re-entrancy guard.
- The `bool roundUp` argument is silently discarded – the only adjustor in the whole system that does so.

### 2. Where the value is consumed

During every user-facing path (`SwapFacet.swap`, `ValueFacet.{add/remove}*`, etc.) the flow is:

```solidity
a)   … compute nominal amounts
b)   {in/out} vertex.trimBalance()     ← state-changing, may touch vault
c)   AdjustorLib.toReal()              ← vulnerable call
d)   final token transfers

```

Example (exact-in swap):

```solidity
uint256 nominalOut;            // produced in b)
...
outAmount = AdjustorLib.toReal(outVid.idx(), nominalOut, false); // (c)
Store.vertex(outVid).withdraw(cid, outAmount, true);             // (d)

```

Because `trimBalance()` may withdraw or deposit shares inside the same vault *before* step (c):

```solidity
// Vertex.trimBalance
uint256 residual = realBalance - targetReal;
vProxy.withdraw(cid, residual);      // decreases totalShares, changes rate
vProxy.commit();                     // executes ERC4626.withdraw()

```

the price embedded in `convertToAssets()` differs from that used earlier in the calculation.

### 3. Manipulation

An attacker needs an ERC-4626 position that Burve already accepts.  Many real-world vaults – and the trivial `NoopVault` shipped in the repo – expose at least one of the following:

1. **Donate-then-Sweep (“flash-donation”)**
    
    *Send N tokens directly to the vault (not via `deposit`).*
    
    Total assets +, total shares unchanged ⇒ rate spikes.
    
    Immediately after Burve finishes using the inflated rate, call a vault-owner hook (or flash-loan helper) to pull the donation back out.
    
2. **Negative-rebase / Slashing**
    
    A validator slashes, a strategy loses funds, or the vault owner calls `reportLoss()`.
    
    Rate falls mid-transaction; `Vertex.trimBalance()` notices the deficit *but only emits an event*, leaving Burve’s internal accounting unchanged.
    
    Early users can withdraw their nominal balances in full while the pool is still solvent, everyone else is left under-collateralised.
    

Either action can be wrapped in a single atomic bundle (flash loan → manipulate → Burve interaction → restore).

### 4. End-to-end exploit sketch

Assume the attack token is `mV` (a manipulable ERC-4626 backed by USDC).  The pool also contains plain USDC.

```solidity
1. Flash-loan 9 000 000 USDC.
2. donate   9 000 000 USDC  → mV  (rate jumps 10×).
3. call Burve.swap(USDC → mV) for 100 000 USDC.
     – outAmount computed with 10× rate ⇒ attacker receives ≈1 000 000 mV-shares.
4. sweep donated USDC back from vault.
5. repay flash loan (9 000 000 USDC).
   Net: attacker holds 1 000 000 mV-shares ≈ 1 000 000 USDC real value,
        paid only 100 000 USDC.

```

Because the vault’s rate has now returned to normal, those shares redeem 10× more underlying than Burve charged.

### 5. Accounting drift on loss events

If instead the vault *loses* 30 % of assets:

```solidity
totalShares unchanged, convertToAssets() ↓ 30 %.
Burve trimBalance() observes deficit, emits event, returns early.
valueStaked, user balances, etc. stay **over-reported**.
Early withdrawals drain remaining assets; late LPs receive 0.

```

No circuit-breaker, no re-pricing logic exists.

## Impact

Any ERC-4626 token registered in Burve can be exploited to:

- **Steal value in a single atomic transaction** by transiently distorting its share-price (flash-donation / slippage / mis-priced withdraw) and abusing the inconsistent price used inside `E4626ViewAdjustor.toReal()`.
- **Drain honest LPs after a vault loss** – internal accounting does not down-scale stakes, enabling a first-withdrawer jackpot and systemic insolvency.

An attacker can convert a six-figure deposit into seven-figure proceeds, or gradually zero-out a closure once a backing vault incurs any negative rebase, making this a critical, protocol-wide fund-loss vulnerability.
