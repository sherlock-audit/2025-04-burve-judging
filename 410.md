# Incorrect Order of valueStaked and bgtValueStaked Updates in addValueSingle

# Incorrect Order of valueStaked and bgtValueStaked Updates in addValueSingle

### Summary

In the `Closure::addValueSingle` function, the contract increases `self.valueStaked` and `self.bgtValueStaked` **before** distributing the fee earnings, even though the comment explicitly states these updates should happen **after** fee earnings. This leads to the new depositor unfairly participating in the fee distribution meant solely for existing LPs, ultimately harming the interests of normal LP users.


### Root Cause

The issue occurs in `Closure.sol`’s `addValueSingle`:

```solidity
function addValueSingle(
    Closure storage self,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue,
    VertexId vid
) internal returns (uint256 requiredAmount, uint256 tax) {
    ......

    // This needs to happen after any fee earnings.
    self.valueStaked += value;
    self.bgtValueStaked += bgtValue;
}
```

The comment notes that the increases to `valueStaked` and `bgtValueStaked` should occur **after** fee earnings are distributed, which is logical:
When a user calls `ValueFacet::addValueSingle`, the protocol and LPs charge a fee, meaning the user needs to provide slightly more tokens, but they should not receive any share of that fee.

However, in `ValueFacet.sol`’s `addValueSingle` function, it first calls `Closure::addValueSingle`, **which already updates** `self.valueStaked` and `self.bgtValueStaked`, **before** distributing the fee earnings.

```solidity
function addValueSingle(
    address recipient,
    uint16 _closureId,
    uint128 value,
    uint128 bgtValue,
    address token,
    uint128 maxRequired
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 requiredBalance) {
    if (value == 0) revert DeMinimisDeposit();
    require(bgtValue <= value, InsufficientValueForBgt(value, bgtValue));
    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(_closureId);
    Closure storage c = Store.closure(cid); // Validates cid.
    VertexId vid = VertexLib.newId(token); // Validates token.
@>  (uint256 nominalRequired, uint256 nominalTax) = c.addValueSingle(  // @audit update self.valueStaked and self.bgtValueStaked
        value,
        bgtValue,
        vid
    );

......

@>  c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);   // @audit distribute the fee earnings
    Store.vertex(vid).deposit(cid, requiredBalance - realTax);
    Store.assets().add(recipient, cid, value, bgtValue);
}
```

The actual call to distribute fees happens **later**:

```solidity
c.addEarnings(vid, realTax);  
Store.vertex(vid).deposit(cid, requiredBalance - realTax);
Store.assets().add(recipient, cid, value, bgtValue);
```

This means that when `addEarnings(vid, realTax)` runs, it uses the **updated** `self.valueStaked` and `self.bgtValueStaked` — meaning the current depositing user also participates in fee distribution.
This is incorrect because the fee is intended to reward **existing** LPs, and the new depositor should not receive back part of the extra fee they themselves just contributed.


### Attack Path

By updating the staked values before distributing the fee, the new depositor improperly dilutes the share of the fees meant for long-term liquidity providers.
In effect, the depositor pays a fee but immediately gains back part of it through their own newly added stake, undermining the fairness of the reward system.

### Impact

This misordering directly harms the interests of normal LP users by allowing new depositors to illegitimately share in the fees meant to reward existing liquidity. Over time, this can significantly erode LP rewards, distort protocol incentives, and create unfair gains for frequent add-remove attackers.


### Mitigation

The fix is to take a snapshot of `self.valueStaked` and `self.bgtValueStaked` **before** calling `Closure::addValueSingle` (which updates these values), and then use the snapshot values when calculating and distributing the fee via `addEarnings`. This ensures that the fee distribution correctly excludes the new depositor’s just-added stake, without requiring complex reordering of the existing logic.
