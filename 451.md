# No Fee will be charges in case of `removeValueSingle`

### Summary

When a user withdraws assets via `removeValueSingle`, the protocol uses `removedBalance` (which is `0`) to compute `realTax`.  
As a result, `realTax` is always `0`, allowing the user to bypass withdrawal fees entirely.


### Root Cause

In [ValueFacet.sol#L235-L239](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L235-L239) we multiple `removedBalance` with other values to calculate the `realTax` , But the `removedBalance = 0` here.


### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol Charge Fee on deposit and withdrawal of values.


### External Pre-conditions

NIL

### Attack Path

NIL

### Impact

Since no fee is charged during `removeValueSingle` withdrawals, the protocol incurs a loss of value, undermining its fee model.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The Best Fix would be following:
```diff
        uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
-           removedBalance,
+           realRemoved,
            nominalTax,
            removedNominal
        );

```
