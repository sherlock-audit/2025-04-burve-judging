# Incorrect Netting Logic in `commit()`

### Summary

The `commit()` function, responsible for processing deposits and withdrawals, contains faulty logic in its netting section. When both `assetsToDeposit` and `assetsToWithdraw` are non-zero, the subtraction order is incorrect, causing the netting to be skipped entirely in certain branches. This can result in over-withdrawal, incorrect accounting, and unnecessary fees.


### Root Cause

In the branch where `assetsToDeposit <= assetsToWithdraw`, the subtraction operation uses a zeroed variable, making it ineffective:
```solidity
assetsToDeposit = 0;
assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit; // This has no effect, as assetsToDeposit is now 0
```
which happens here `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L72`

### Internal Pre-conditions

- `assetsToDeposit` and `assetsToWithdraw` are both non-zero.

- The function `commit()` is called internally with values set in `temp.vars[1]` and `temp.vars[2]`.



### External Pre-conditions

- A user triggers operations leading to both a deposit and a withdrawal in the same transaction or execution frame.

-  The calling contract or system does not sanitize or override the `commit()` logic before execution.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious or unintentional transaction creates a `VaultTemp` context where both `assetsToDeposit` and `assetsToWithdraw` are non-zero.

2. Due to incorrect subtraction logic, the intended netting does not occur.

3. As a result:

 - Excessive withdrawals can happen.

 - Total vault share accounting becomes inconsistent.

 - More vault interactions are triggered than necessary, increasing slippage or fee exposure.

### Impact

While this issue does not directly lead to asset theft, it allows unintended over-withdrawal and incorrect accounting, which could:

- Undermine system invariants.

- Cause user balances to desynchronize.

- Lead to unnecessary fees or vault penalties.

- Result in operational failures or accounting drift over time.



### PoC

Consider the following example:
```solidity
VaultTemp memory temp;
temp.vars[1] = 5 ether; // assetsToDeposit
temp.vars[2] = 10 ether; // assetsToWithdraw

// commit() will run this:
if (assetsToDeposit > 0 && assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
    if (assetsToDeposit > assetsToWithdraw) {
        assetsToDeposit -= assetsToWithdraw;
        assetsToWithdraw = 0;
    } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
        assetsToDeposit = 0;
        assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit; // <= BUG: this is subtracting 0
    } else {
        return;
    }
}

// assetsToWithdraw remains 10 ether instead of the correct 5 ether



```

### Mitigation

Replace the incorrect subtraction logic with proper order of operations:
```solidity
} else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
    assetsToDeposit = 0;
}

```
This ensures that the original value of assetsToDeposit is used before setting it to zero.
