# Missing `acceptOwnership` selector in the `Diamond.sol` facet initialization

### Summary

The `Burve` protocol utilizes the Diamond style proxy for its upgradeability pattern. For this pattern to work, all `facet` selectors must be defined in the `FacetCut`, so that the `Diamond` can call them. The protocol also uses a specialized `BaseAdminFacet`, which allows granular admin control over the functionalities. However, the protocol has failed to add the `acceptOwnership` to the initialized selectors, meaning that any `transferOwnership` actions won't be able to be completed, as the new owner cannot accept the transfer.

### Root Cause

Missing `acceptOwnership` selector in the `Diamond.sol` [facet initialization](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L67-L77).

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin calls `transferOwnership` with the new owner address.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The new owner cannot accept the ownership transfer, which could be a serious issue in the event of the multisig being compromised.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Add the `acceptOwnership` selector to the facets:
