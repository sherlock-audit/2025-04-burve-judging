# Attacker will cause potential misinformation for users/systems relying on view functions

### Summary


The lack of an overflow check in [`FullMath.mulX128`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L230) will cause potential misinformation for users or external systems relying on view functions like [`ValueFacet.queryValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L280) as extreme internal state conditions (potentially influenced by an attacker or market volatility) will cause the earnings calculation to silently wrap around.

### Root Cause

In [`FullMath.mulX128`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L230) the function calculates `(a * b) >> 128` using assembly but omits a check to ensure the final result fits within `uint256`. 
If the mathematical result is greater than or equal to `2**256`, the function returns a mathematically incorrect, wrapped value instead of reverting.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  A `Closure` state needs to exist where a rate variable used in  [`ValueFacet.queryValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L280)  (e.g., `realEPVX128`, `upvX128`, `bpvX128`) is extremely high.
2.  A user needs to have a sufficiently large `value` or `bgtValue` deposited in that specific `Closure`.
3.  The product of the specific rate and the corresponding user value component (`nonValue` or `bgtValue`) must be large enough such that `(rate * value) >> 128` would mathematically exceed `type(uint256).max` (i.e., `rate * value >= 2**384`).

### External Pre-conditions

1.  None strictly required, as extreme internal rates could theoretically be reached over time or via complex interactions. However, extreme external market conditions reflected in the protocol's internal pricing could accelerate reaching the necessary internal pre-conditions.

### Attack Path

1.  System state (potentially influenced by attacker actions or extreme market conditions) causes a rate (e.g., `realEPVX128[i]`) in a specific `Closure` to reach an extremely high value (e.g., `~2**250`).
2.  A user has a large position (e.g., `nonValue` derived from their deposit is `~2**126`) in the same `Closure`.
3.  Anyone (user via UI, an off-chain bot, another contract) calls `ValueFacet.queryValue(user, closureId)`.
4.  Inside `queryValue`, the calculation `earnings[i] += FullMath.mulX128(rate, nonValue, false)` is performed.
5.  Because `rate * nonValue` is approximately `2**250 * 2**126 = 2**376`, the intermediate 512-bit product is large enough that the subsequent shift and additions within `mulX128` cause the final `uint256` result to wrap around (as demonstrated in PoC).
6.  [`FullMath.mulX128`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/FullMath.sol#L230) returns a small, incorrect value instead of the true large value (which wouldn't fit in `uint256`) or reverting.
7.  [`ValueFacet.queryValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L280) completes successfully but returns earnings data that is significantly understated for the affected token.

### Impact

Users or systems relying on [`ValueFacet.queryValue`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L280) suffer from incorrect data regarding potential earnings. This can lead to incorrect UI displays (showing near-zero earnings when they should be high), flawed decision-making by users or automated systems based on this data, or failure of off-chain monitoring/alerting logic. There is no direct loss of deposited funds or accrued shares from this specific overflow, as `collectEarnings` relies on internally stored share amounts.

### Mitigation

Add an overflow check within the FullMath.mulX128 function. Before returning the result res, check if it is less than the intermediate value add(shr(128, bot), shl(128, top)) calculated before the final add involving rounding. If the final result is smaller, it indicates an overflow occurred during the addition (specifically the shl(128, top) part wrapping). Alternatively, perform the calculation using a larger intermediate type or add checks similar to mulDivRoundingUp to ensure the final result does not exceed type(uint256).max.

A simpler, though potentially less gas-efficient, approach is to check if top >= (1 << 128). If this is true, any non-zero bot value would cause (a * b) >> 128 to exceed type(uint256).max, so the function should revert in this case.

```solidity
    function mulX128(
        uint256 a,
        uint256 b,
        bool roundUp
         ) internal pure returns (uint256 res) {
        (uint256 bot, uint256 top) = FullMath.mul512(a, b);
        // --- Mitigation Start ---
        // If top >= 2**128, the result (top << 128) will wrap or be zero.
        // If top >= 2**128 and bot is non-zero, the true result >> 128 must be >= 2**256.
        // A simpler check: if top is already >= 2**128, the result is likely too large.
        require(top < (1 << 128), "FullMath: mulX128 overflow");
        // --- Mitigation End ---
        uint256 modmax = 1 << 128;
        assembly {
            res := add(
                add(shr(128, bot), shl(128, top)), 
                and(roundUp, gt(mod(bot, modmax), 0))
            )
            // Add check for overflow during the final 'add' if rounding is applied
            if and(roundUp, gt(mod(bot, modmax), 0)) {
                 // Check if adding 1 caused overflow
                 require(res > shr(128, bot), "FullMath: mulX128 rounding overflow"); // Simplified check
            }
        }
