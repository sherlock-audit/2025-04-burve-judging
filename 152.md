# BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership not registered in Diamond, making owner changes impossible

### Summary

Since `BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership` function is implemented as 2 steps, `BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership` function must also be registered in Diamond. However, since it's not registered, owner changes are impossible.

### Root Cause

The `BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership` function is implemented as 2 steps. [lib/Commons/src/Util/Admin.sol#L155](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/lib/Commons/src/Util/Admin.sol#L155) 

Therefore, the `BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership` function signature should also be registered.

```solidity
function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external override {
    AdminLib.reassignOwner(_newOwner);
}

function reassignOwner(address newOwner) internal {
    validateOwner();
@>  adminStore().pendingOwner = newOwner;
}
```

However, when initializing Diamond, `BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership` is not registered. [multi/Diamond.sol#L68-L71](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/Diamond.sol#L68-L71)

Therefore, the owner change functionality will not work until this function is added.

```solidity
{
    bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](3);
@>  adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
    adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
    adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;
    cuts[2] = FacetCut({
        facetAddress: address(new BaseAdminFacet()),
        action: FacetCutAction.Add,
        functionSelectors: adminSelectors
    });
}
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Deploy and initialize Diamond contract. There is an error in the initialization code


### Impact

The owner change functionality will not work until `BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership` is registered in Diamond.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Register the `BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership` function in the Diamond constructor.

```diff
{
-   bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](3);
+   bytes4[] memory adminSelectors = new bytes4[](4);
    adminSelectors[0] = BaseAdminFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
    adminSelectors[1] = BaseAdminFacet.owner.selector;
    adminSelectors[2] = BaseAdminFacet.adminRights.selector;
+   adminSelectors[3] = BaseAdminFacet.acceptOwnership.selector;
    cuts[2] = FacetCut({
        facetAddress: address(new BaseAdminFacet()),
        action: FacetCutAction.Add,
        functionSelectors: adminSelectors
    });
}
```
