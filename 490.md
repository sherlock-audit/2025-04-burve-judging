# Netting Bug in E4626.sol commit Function

### Summary

A logic bug in the netting process of the `commit` function in `E4626.sol` causes excessive withdrawal when a user attempts to deposit and withdraw in the same transaction, with the withdrawal amount greater than the deposit. This can result in user balances being reduced by more than the net intended amount

### Root Cause

In [`E4626.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/44cba36e2a0c3cd7b6999459bf7746db92f8cc0a/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L71-L74) the following code in the `commit` function incorrectly nets deposit and withdrawal amounts:
```solidity
else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToDeposit = 0;
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
}
```
Here, `assetsToDeposit` is set to 0 before it is subtracted from `assetsToWithdraw`, so no netting occurs and the full withdrawal is processed.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have an existing share balance in the vault.
2. User initiates a transaction that both deposits and withdraws in the same commit, with `withdraw > deposit`.

### External Pre-conditions

- No special external conditions required; vault and token must be functional.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits a small amount.
2. User then, in a single operation, deposits a smaller amount and withdraws a larger amount.
3. The contract processes the full withdrawal, not the net difference, reducing the user's balance by more than intended.

### Impact

Users can lose more shares than intended when performing simultaneous deposit and withdrawal operations, leading to potential unexpected losses.

### PoC

```solidity
function testNettingBugWithdrawGreaterThanDeposit() public {
    // Setup: Give this contract a large token balance and approve
    ClosureId cid = ClosureId.wrap(1);
    VaultTemp memory temp;
    vault.fetch(temp);
    // Deposit a small amount
    vault.deposit(temp, cid, 1e10);
    vault.commit(temp);
    // Now try to deposit a small amount and withdraw a larger amount in the same op
    vault.fetch(temp);
    vault.deposit(temp, cid, 1e6); // deposit 1e6
    vault.withdraw(temp, cid, 1e7); // withdraw 1e7 (greater than deposit)
    // Commit should net out and only withdraw (1e7 - 1e6) = 9e6, but due to bug, will withdraw 1e7
    uint256 beforeShares = vault.shares[cid];
    vault.commit(temp);
    uint256 afterShares = vault.shares[cid];
    uint256 expectedShares = beforeShares - (1e7 - 1e6); // Should only subtract the net difference
    // This will fail if the bug is present
    assertEq(afterShares, expectedShares, "Netting bug: shares not netted correctly");
}
```

### Test Output
```solidity
[FAIL: Netting bug: shares not netted correctly: 9995500000 != 9986500000] testNettingBugWithdrawGreaterThanDeposit() (gas: 207265)
```

### Mitigation

Update the `commit` function in `E4626.sol` so that the original value of `assetsToDeposit` is subtracted from `assetsToWithdraw` before setting `assetsToDeposit` to zero. The corrected code should be:

```solidity
else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
    assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
    assetsToDeposit = 0;
}
```
