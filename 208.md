# Inconsistent Accounting Basis in VaultE4626Impl in E4626.sol will cause Inaccurate Value Accounting and Potential Value Drift for Users/LPs

### Summary

Inconsistent accounting basis (**using discounted amount for internal shares vs. original amount for external deposits**) in `VaultE4626Impl`  in `E4626.sol` will cause inaccurate internal value calculations and potential long-term value drift for Users/LPs as the protocol's deposit/commit logic leads to a divergence between internal share records (`totalShares`) and external vault holdings (`totalVaultShares`).

### Root Cause

- The core issue is a conceptual mistake in how deposit accounting is handled between the internal state update in `VaultE4626Impl.deposit` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L104-L128 and the external interaction in `VaultE4626Impl.commit` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L61C5-L100C6.

- In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L122-L126, the `deposit` function calculates `newShares` to be added internally based on a `discountedAmount`, which is derived from the original `amount` potentially reduced by an external vault's fee/exchange rate factor (`temp.vars[3]`).
```solidity
uint256 discountedAmount = FullMath.mulX128(amount, temp.vars[3], false);
uint256 newShares = totalAssets == 0
    ? discountedAmount // Also problematic for first deposit
    : FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, discountedAmount, totalAssets);
self.shares[cid] += newShares;
self.totalShares += newShares; // <====== Internal totalShares increases based on discountedAmount

```
- However, the original `amount` is added to the temporary deposit queue: `temp.vars[1] += amount`;
- Later, the `commit` function deposits the accumulated original `amount` (`assetsToDeposit = temp.vars[1]`) into the external vault and updates self.totalVaultShares based on the shares actually received from the external vault for that original amount.
```solidity
if (assetsToDeposit > 0) {
     // ... approve ...
     self.totalVaultShares += self.vault.deposit(
         assetsToDeposit, // <====== Original amount is deposited externally
         address(this)
     );
    // ... reset approve ...
 }

```
- This discrepancy means the basis for increasing internal shares (`discountedAmount`) differs from the basis for increasing external shares (`amount`), leading to a **divergence** between `self.totalShares` and `self.totalVaultShares`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A `user` needs to deposit funds via a function calling `VaultE4626Impl.deposit` (e.g., ValueFacet.addValue).

2. The calculation of the fee/exchange rate factor `temp.vars[3]` (derived from `previewRedeem(previewDeposit(...))`) must result in a value different from `1 << 128` (i.e., not exactly 1), causing `discountedAmount` to differ from amount. This is likely if the external vault has deposit/redemption fees or any minor value fluctuation.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The integrated external ERC4626 `vault` must exhibit characteristics (like fees or internal yield/loss causing slight exchange rate deviations) such that `previewRedeem(previewDeposit(X))` does not always precisely equal `X`, leading to `temp.vars[3]` deviating from `1 << 128`.

### Attack Path

1. A `user` deposits `amount` of the underlying token.

2. `VaultE4626Impl.deposit` calculates `discountedAmount < amount` because `temp.vars[3]` is less than `1 << 128`.

3. `VaultE4626Impl.deposit` calculates `newShares` based on the `discountedAmount` and the current internal `totalAssets / totalShares` ratio.

4. `self.totalShares` is incremented by `newShares`.

5. The original `amount` is added to `temp.vars[1]`.

6. Later, `VaultE4626Impl.commit` is called.

7. `commit` deposits the original `amount` (`assetsToDeposit`) into the external `vault`.

8. `commit` increments `self.totalVaultShares` by the `actualSharesReceived` from the external vault deposit (which corresponds to the deposit of `amount`).

9. Because `newShares` (added to `totalShares`) was calculated based on `discountedAmount`, while `actualSharesReceived` (added to `totalVaultShares`) was based on `amount`, the ratio `totalAssets / totalShares` (where `totalAssets` is derived from `totalVaultShares`) begins to diverge from the external vault's true asset/share ratio.

10. This divergence accumulates with subsequent deposits where `discountedAmount != amount`.

11. Later calls to functions like `VaultE4626Impl.balance`, which rely on the internal `totalAssets / totalShares` ratio to calculate the asset value of internal shares, will return increasingly inaccurate results.

### Impact

The protocol's internal accounting (`totalShares` and derived values) diverges from the reality of its external holdings (`totalVaultShares`), leading to:

1. Inaccurate Value Representation: Functions like `VaultE4626Impl.balance` will provide an incorrect view of the underlying asset value represented by a user's internal shares (`self.shares[cid]`). Users/LPs relying on these views suffer from inaccurate information about their position's worth.

2. Potential Value Drift / Unfairness: When Users/LPs withdraw funds, the amount received might be calculated based on the inaccurate internal ratio. Over time, this could lead to users consistently receiving slightly more or less than the true pro-rata value of their share in the external vault, causing value drift and unfairness among LPs.

3. Compromised Protocol Integrity: The core function of accurately tracking and valuing user deposits is compromised. This inaccuracy can undermine trust and potentially be exploited if the deviation becomes significant enough or interacts negatively with other protocol mechanics (e.g., fee distribution, collateral value calculations if integrated elsewhere).

### PoC

Assume the following simplified scenario:

- External ERC4626 vault issues shares 1:1 with deposited assets (no deposit fee).

- Due to potential redemption fees or minor fluctuations, the calculated `temp.vars[3]` (discount factor) is consistently 0.99 * (1 << 128).

- Initial state: `self.totalShares = 0`, `self.totalVaultShares = 0`.

**Deposit 1 (User A)**: `amount = 1000`

1. `deposit` (Internal):

- discountedAmount = 1000 * 0.99 = 990.

- `totalAssets` is 0, so newShares = discountedAmount = 990.

- `self.totalShares` becomes 990.

- `temp.vars[1]` (pending deposit) becomes 1000.

2. `commit` (External):

- assetsToDeposit = 1000.

- vault.deposit(1000, ...) returns actualSharesReceived = 1000 (due to 1:1 issuance).

- `self.totalVaultShares` becomes 1000.

3. State After A: totalShares = 990, totalVaultShares = 1000. Inconsistency: Internal shares < External shares.


**Deposit 2 (User B)**: `amount = 1000`

1. `deposit` (Internal):

- `fetch`: totalAssets = previewRedeem(totalVaultShares=1000). Assuming `previewRedeem` reflects the 0.99 factor, totalAssets = 990. temp.vars[3] is still 0.99 * (1<<128).

- discountedAmount = 1000 * 0.99 = 990.

- newShares = mulDiv(totalShares=990, discountedAmount=990, totalAssets=990) = 990.

- `self.totalShares` becomes 990 + 990 = 1980.

- temp.vars[1] becomes 1000.

2. `commit` (External):

- `assetsToDeposit` = 1000.

- vault.deposit(1000, ...) returns actualSharesReceived = 1000.

- self.totalVaultShares becomes 1000 + 1000 = 2000.

3. State After B: `totalShares` = 1980, `totalVaultShares` = 2000. **Inconsistency persists and grows proportionally**.

This example demonstrates how the differing accounting bases cause `totalShares` (internal record based on discounted value) and `totalVaultShares` (external record based on original deposit amount) to diverge over time. This divergence invalidates the accuracy of internal calculations relying on the `totalAssets / totalShares` ratio.

### Mitigation

Adopt a consistent accounting basis. The recommended approach is to base internal share accounting on the original `amount`:

1. **Modify `VaultE4626Impl.deposit`**: Calculate `newShares` based on the original `amount`, not `discountedAmount`. Handle the `totalAssets == 0` case by setting `newShares = amount` (establishing a 1:1 initial internal ratio).
```solidity
function deposit(...) internal {
    // ... calculate totalAssets ...

    uint256 newShares;
    if (totalAssets == 0 && self.totalShares == 0) { // Check for true first deposit
         newShares = amount; // Use original amount for 1:1 initial internal ratio
    } else {
         // Use original amount for proportional calculation
         newShares = FullMath.mulDiv(self.totalShares, amount, totalAssets);
    }
    self.shares[cid] += newShares;
    self.totalShares += newShares;
    temp.vars[1] += amount;
}
```
2. **Adjust Value Calculation**: Functions like `balance` should be aware that `totalShares` represents the input proportion. To get the current asset value, they must calculate the current value of `self.totalVaultShares` (using `previewRedeem`) and then apply the user's pro-rata share (`self.shares[cid] / self.totalShares`). Alternatively, calculate a dynamic exchange rate `currentTotalAssets / self.totalShares` and multiply by `self.shares[cid]`. This explicitly accounts for external vault performance/fees during value retrieval, rather than trying to bake it into the share allocation itself.
