# Missing User Balance Tracking in `BGTExchanger::fund` Function

### Summary

The `BGTExchanger::fund` function allows users to deposit BGT into the contract, increasing the global `bgtBalance`. However, it does not record or track which user deposited how much. This leads to a lack of accountability, prevents future refunding or ownership-based logic, and opens up the risk of locked funds.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.sol#L116-L124

The function only updates a single global variable (`bgtBalance`) when users deposit tokens. It fails to maintain individual accounting by not mapping user addresses to their respective deposit amounts. This omission makes it impossible to determine who owns the deposited BGT tokens.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The contract has a global variable `bgtBalance` that increases with each call to `fund`.
- The `TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom` function succeeds and moves tokens from the user to the contract.

### External Pre-conditions

- Any user can call `fund` without restrictions.
- The user has sufficient BGT balance and has approved the contract to spend it.

### Attack Path

- Multiple users (e.g., Alice and Bob) call `fund` with varying BGT amounts.

- Later, if any logic attempts to refund or reward users based on deposits, it will be impossible to determine how much each contributed and funds remain locked.

### Impact

- Loss of user attribution: Deposits are not mapped to users, preventing fair refunds or reward distribution.
- Protocol inconsistency: Any future logic that relies on individual deposit amounts becomes unreliable.
- Potential user disputes and fund misallocation.

### PoC

Paste the following test in `test/integrations/BGTExchange/BGTExchanger.t.sol` file.

```solidity
function testLockedBGT() public {
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        bgtExchanger.addExchanger(alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(owner);
        bgtExchanger.setRate(address(usdc), (2 << 128)); // 1:2
        vm.stopPrank();

        deal(address(ibgt), address(this), 100e18);
        ibgt.approve(address(bgtExchanger), 100e18);
        bgtExchanger.fund(100e18);

        vm.startPrank(alice);

        deal(address(usdc), alice, 200e18);
        usdc.approve(address(bgtExchanger), 200e18);
        (uint256 bgtAmount, uint256 spendAmount) = bgtExchanger.exchange(
            address(usdc),
            50e18
        );
        bgtExchanger.withdraw(alice, bgtAmount);
        ibgt.approve(address(bgtExchanger), bgtAmount);
        bgtExchanger.fund(bgtAmount);
        vm.expectRevert();
        bgtExchanger.withdraw(alice, bgtAmount);

        vm.stopPrank();
}
```

### Mitigation

- Introduce a mapping to track per-user balances:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public userBgtBalance;

function fund(uint256 amount) external {
    TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(
        bgtToken,
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount
    );
    bgtBalance += amount;
    userBgtBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
}
```

- Alternatively, make the purpose of `fund` clear if it's not meant to be user-specifi, e.g., only allow owner or an authorizedExchanger to call it.
