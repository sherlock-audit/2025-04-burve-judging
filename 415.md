# Base-fee is under-collected in single-token value changes

### Summary

When a user adds or removes value with one token, only the part of the transfer that fixes the pool’s imbalance is fed into the fee formula.
The “pro-rata” portion – the amount that would have been moved by a fully proportional (multi-token) operation – is left untaxed. As a result the effective fee rate is always lower than `baseFeeX128` and can be significantly cheaper for large or frequent single-token actions.

### Root Cause
`Closure::addValueSingle`:
The code first computes `fairVBalance – oldBalance`. This is the share of the in-token that a proportional deposit would contribute. It is left completely untaxed:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L175-L179
```solidity
        //@audit-info fairVBalance is the new balance of vIdx
        uint256 fairVBalance = iterSingleValueDiff(self, valIter, true);
        //@audit-info so here, requiredAmount is the difference in previous and new balance
        requiredAmount = fairVBalance - self.balances[valIter.vIdx];
```
It then calculates the new value for `fairVBalance`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L182-L188
```solidity
            uint256 veX128 = SimplexLib.getEX128(valIter.vIdx);
            uint256 currentValueX128 = ValueLib.v(
                self.targetX128,
                veX128,
                fairVBalance, //@audit-info calculate the value equivalent for fairVBalance
                false
            );
```
and then adds the value gap of other tokens to `currentValueX128` and calculates new `X` (new balance of `vIdx`):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L190-L195
```solidity
            finalAmount = ValueLib.x(
                self.targetX128,
                veX128,
                currentValueX128 + valIter.valueSumX128, //@audit-info add new value of vIdx to value gap
                true
            );
```
then calculates fees, _**but the fee is only charged from the X for the value gap, not the total `X` that is going to be added:**_
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L198-L205
```solidity
            //@audit-info this is the X added to compensate the value gap for OTHER tokens
            uint256 untaxedRequired = finalAmount - fairVBalance;
            self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);
            //@audit-info the tax is charged from the X compensated for value gap of other tokens
            uint256 taxedRequired = UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp(
                untaxedRequired << 128,
                ONEX128 - self.baseFeeX128
            );
            tax = taxedRequired - untaxedRequired;
            //@audit-info the tax is then added to requiredAmount, but is not exactly baseFee percent of requiredAmount
            requiredAmount += taxedRequired;
```
Same thing is happening in `removeValueSingle`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/closure/Closure.sol#L279-L288
```solidity
        uint256 finalAmount = ValueLib.x(
            self.targetX128,
            veX128,
            currentValueX128 - valIter.valueSumX128,
            true
        );
        uint256 untaxedRemove = fairVBalance - finalAmount;
        self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);
        tax = FullMath.mulX128(untaxedRemove, self.baseFeeX128, true);
        removedAmount += untaxedRemove - tax;
```
the `tax` is calculated from `untaxedRemoved` which is the amount of `X` removed to compensate for the value gaps in other closure tokens.
Later the `realTax` is calculated by multiplying the `requiredBalance` by `nominalTax/nominalRequired`:
```solidity
        uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(
            requiredBalance,
            nominalTax,
            nominalRequired
        );
```
but the `nominalTax/nominalRequired` is less than base fee.

### Internal Pre-conditions
- `baseFeeX128 > 0`

### External Pre-conditions
- user adding/removing values using `addValueSingle` or `removeValueSingle`

### Attack Path
---

### Impact
Fees are under-collected: fees are even more under-collected if the value gap created in other tokens is minimal, lets say that token `A` has the most `x` in the closure, and token `B` and `C` have way less amounts in the closure. in this case the value gap for `B` and `C` will be charged with tax not the total `A` added to closure.

### PoC
First add this `console.log`s into `Closure::addValueSingle` to simply log some values after settings fees:
```solidity
            tax = taxedRequired - untaxedRequired;
            requiredAmount += taxedRequired;
            console.log("taxedRequired: %s", taxedRequired);
            console.log("requiredAmount: %s", requiredAmount);
            console.log("tax/requierdAmount ratio", (tax * 1e18) / requiredAmount);
        }
```
then add this test to `test/facet/ValueFacet.t.sol`:
```solidity
    function testTaxUnderPay() public {
        //first increase the base fee to 10%
        vm.startPrank(owner);
        //34028236692093846346337460743176821145 = 10% fee
        simplexFacet.setClosureFees(0xF, 34028236692093846346337460743176821145, 0);
        vm.stopPrank();

        valueFacet.addValueSingle(
            address(this),
            0xF,
            1e18,
            1e18,
            tokens[0],
            ~uint128(0)
        );
    }

```
result:
```log
[PASS] testTaxUnderPay() (gas: 893890)
Logs:
  taxedRequired: 834089705771121705
  requiredAmount: 1084089705771121706
  tax/requierdAmount ratio 76939177757234306
```
instead of charging 10%, only 7.6% tax was charged, the other 2.5% was from the token we were using as `vIdx`

### Mitigation

To get the perfect tax, we can change the code logic to:
```solidity
            uint256 untaxedRequired = finalAmount - fairVBalance;
            self.setBalance(valIter.vIdx, finalAmount);
            requiredAmount += untaxedRequired;
            uint256 taxedRequired = UnsafeMath.divRoundingUp(
                requiredAmount << 128,
                ONEX128 - self.baseFeeX128
            );
            tax = taxedRequired - requiredAmount;
            requiredAmount = taxedRequired;
            console.log("taxedRequired: %s", taxedRequired);
            console.log("requiredAmount: %s", requiredAmount);
            console.log(
                "tax/requierdAmount ratio",
                (tax * 1e18) / requiredAmount
            );
```
if we run the PoC again, the result will be exactly 10% which is the correct way to calculate tax:
```log
  taxedRequired: 1111867483548899484
  requiredAmount: 1111867483548899484
  tax/requierdAmount ratio 100000000000000000
```
