# Missing Lock Check in `stakeValue`

### Summary

The `stakeValue` function fails to enforce the “no staking when any vertex is locked” invariant, allowing value to be staked even if one or more tokens in the closure are locked.


### Root Cause


In the `ClosureImpl` library, the `unstakeValue` function correctly checks whether any token in the closure is locked before allowing an unstake:

```solidity
function unstakeValue(
    Closure storage self,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue
) internal {
    trimAllBalances(self);
    require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
    // ...
    self.valueStaked -= value;
    self.bgtValueStaked -= bgtValue;
}
```

However, the symmetric operation `stakeValue`—which allows a user to stake (i.e. lock up) value tokens into a closure—does **not** include this lock guard:

```solidity
function stakeValue(
    Closure storage self,
    uint256 value,
    uint256 bgtValue
) internal {
    trimAllBalances(self);
    uint256 maxValue = (self.targetX128 * self.n) >> 128;
    // ... checks capacity ...
    self.valueStaked += value;
    self.bgtValueStaked += bgtValue;
}
```

Because `stakeValue` omits the `require(!isAnyLocked(self), ...)` guard, it permits staking new value even when some underlying token-vertices in the closure are locked.

### Impact


The absence of a lock check in `stakeValue` allows users to stake value tokens even when associated tokens are locked, leading to potential inconsistencies during critical operations like vault migrations. This could result in incorrect accounting of staked values and expose users to financial risks if locked tokens experience instability.

1. **Locked Token Context:**
   - When a token is locked (via `LockFacet`), its vault might be undergoing critical operations (e.g., migration, emergency pause).
   - Locked tokens should restrict state-changing operations to prevent inconsistent balances.

2. **Impact of Missing Check in `stakeValue`:**
   - Users can stake value tokens into a closure containing locked tokens.
   - Staking interacts with `trimAllBalances`, which updates token balances without reverting if locked.
   - If the locked token's underlying vault is in an invalid state (e.g., mid-migration), staking could:
     - Calculate incorrect token balances for the closure.
     - Distribute earnings unfairly due to stale or invalid balance data.
     - Allow value staking based on unreliable pricing, leading to arbitrage or losses.

### Mitigation


Add the lock check to `stakeValue` to ensure consistency with other sensitive operations:

```diff
 function stakeValue(
     Closure storage self,
     uint256 value,
     uint256 bgtValue
 ) internal {
-    trimAllBalances(self);
+    trimAllBalances(self);
+    // Prevent staking when any token in the closure is locked
+    require(!isAnyLocked(self), CannotRemoveWithLockedVertex(self.cid));
     uint256 maxValue = (self.targetX128 * self.n) >> 128;
     if (self.valueStaked > maxValue + SimplexLib.deMinimusValue())
         emit WarningExcessValueDetected(
             self.cid,
             maxValue,
             self.valueStaked
         );
     if (self.valueStaked + value > maxValue)
         revert InsufficientStakeCapacity(
             self.cid,
             maxValue,
             self.valueStaked,
             value
         );

     self.valueStaked += value;
     self.bgtValueStaked += bgtValue;
 }
```
