# Large fee accumulation will prevent users from burning their positions

### Summary

The burnV3 function's strict token cap will cause denial of service for users as accumulated fees exceeding uint128.max will revert all burn attempts

### Root Cause

In [Burve.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/single/Burve.sol#L437) the burnV3 function reverts if token amounts exceed uint128.max, instead of implementing a partial burn mechanism

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Pool position needs to accumulate fees exceeding uint128.max (~3.4e38)
- Users need to attempt to burn their positions when fees are this high

### External Pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

- A Uniswap V3 position in the Burve contract accumulates very large fees over time
- User attempts to burn their position by calling burn()
- The internal burnV3() function calculates fee amounts via pool.burn()
- If these amounts exceed uint128.max, the function reverts with TooMuchBurnedAtOnce error
- The user is unable to withdraw their liquidity at all

### Impact

Users cannot burn their positions and withdraw their assets when accumulated fees become too large, leading to their liquidity being temporarily locked in the protocol

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume a large amount of fees accumulated over time
// in a position managed by the Burve contract

function testBurnFailure() external {
    // Mock setup where the pool returns very large fee amounts
    mockPool.setFeeAmounts(uint256(type(uint128).max) + 1, 0);
    
    // Attempt to burn position
    vm.expectRevert("TooMuchBurnedAtOnce");
    burve.burn(100, 0, type(uint160).max);
    
    // User cannot withdraw their funds
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement a partial collection mechanism that allows users to burn their position and collect up to uint128.max tokens, leaving the remainder for future collection. This prevents complete locking of funds while still respecting type limits
