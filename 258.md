# Logical Error in ValueFacet Causes Protocol-Wide Fee Bypass

### Summary

The use of an uninitialized variable `removedBalance` inside `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle()` causes a logical error where the protocol fails to collect withdrawal fees. As a result, users receive the full withdrawal amount without paying the intended protocol fee, leading to cumulative protocol revenue loss. This flaw affects only the `removeValueSingle()` withdrawal path.



### Root Cause

In `ValueFacet.sol`; https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/facets/ValueFacet.sol#L235-L239, the contract incorrectly computes `realTax` using the uninitialized `removedBalance` variable:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```
At this point in execution, `removedBalance` has not yet been assigned and defaults to zero. Thus, `realTax` always evaluates to zero, regardless of the correct `nominalTax` computed earlier.
As a result, no fee is credited to the closure, and users receive the full token withdrawal amount.

Correct computation should use:

```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A user has a positive value stake in a closure.

2. The closure contains a nonzero `baseFeeX128`, or other logic causes `nominalTax > 0` during withdrawal.

3. The withdrawal uses `removeValueSingle()`, not the full multi-token `removeValue()` function.

### External Pre-conditions

No assumptions about external tokens as the vulnerability is internal to value calculations.

### Attack Path

1. A user stakes value in a closure.

2. The user calls `removeValueSingle()` to withdraw tokens.

3. Fee calculation misfires due to using uninitialized `removedBalance`.

4. No protocol earnings are credited (`realTax = 0`).

5. The user receives the full token withdrawal, bypassing the intended fee.

### Impact

1. Withdrawals via `removeValueSingle()` bypass the protocol’s ~0.33% withdrawal fee.

2. Protocol earnings per vertex (`earningsPerValueX128`) remain unchanged after withdrawal.

3. The cumulative economic impact scales linearly with withdrawal volume and user activity.

4. Liquidity providers earn less, destabilizing the protocol’s long-term incentive structure.

### PoC

The following PoC demonstrates the fee loss vulnerability by showing that withdrawals via `removeValueSingle()` do not deduct the expected ~0.33% fee, resulting in no earnings credited to the protocol and users receiving the full withdrawal amount.

PoC Explanation

The PoC (FeeLossPoC.sol) demonstrates the fee loss vulnerability in `ValueFacet.removeValueSingle()` by showing that a withdrawal of 1 ETH (1e18 wei) does not credit the expected ~0.33% fee to the protocol, as the earnings per vertex (EPV) remains unchanged. This is due to the logical error where `realTax` is calculated using an uninitialized `removedBalance`, resulting in `realTax` = 0. Below is a breakdown of what the code does:

1. Setup (setUp()):
- Purpose: Initializes a test environment to replicate a protocol state with a closure containing staked tokens, enabling withdrawal tests.

- Actions:
Deploys Contracts: Creates a SimplexDiamond with facets (ValueFacet, SimplexFacet, etc.) and mock tokens (tokA, tokB) with 18 decimals, each paired with a MockERC4626 vault.
Configures Vertices: Adds tokA and tokB as vertices, assigning indices (idxA, idxB) for closure bitmask creation.
Creates Closure: Constructs a closure ID (cid) for a {tokA, tokB} pair, initializing it with BASE_FEE_X128 = 2^128 / 300 (~0.33%) and a total value locked (TVL) of 10 ETH (BIG_STAKE).
Funds Test Account: Mints 20 ETH of tokA and tokB to the test account and approves the diamond for transfers.
Stakes Value: Adds 10 ETH of value to the closure via valueFacet.addValue(), setting the TVL to 20 ETH (10 ETH from BIG_STAKE and 10 ETH from addValue).

- Outcome: Establishes a closure with sufficient stake (≥ 1e18 wei), a 0.33% fee rate, and adequate token balance, meeting the internal pre-conditions for testing withdrawals.


2. Single Withdrawal Test (test_bug_removeValueSingle_taxLost()):

- Purpose: Verifies that withdrawing 1 ETH (1e18 wei) does not credit fees to the protocol, as the EPV for tokA remains unchanged, indicating realTax = 0.

- Actions:
Records Initial EPV: Retrieves the closure’s `earningsPerValueX128[idxA]` for tokA before the withdrawal using `simplex.getClosureFees(cid)`.
Performs Withdrawal: Calls `valueFacet.removeValueSingle()` with value = 1e18 wei, tokA, and cid, expecting a ~0.33% fee (~3.3e15 wei) to be credited to the protocol’s earnings.
Checks Final EPV: Retrieves the EPV after the withdrawal and asserts it equals the initial EPV (assertEq(epvAfter, epvBefore)).

- Outcome: The test passes if epvAfter == epvBefore, proving no fees are credited (c.addEarnings(vid, 0)). This confirms the logical error (`realTax` = `FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal)` with `removedBalance` = 0) causes the protocol to lose the expected fee, as seen in the verbose logs (no EPV increase for value = 1e18).



### Mitigation

Replace:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(removedBalance, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```
with:
```solidity
uint256 realTax = FullMath.mulDiv(realRemoved, nominalTax, removedNominal);
```
thus properly deducting fees and restoring the protocol’s accounting invariant.
