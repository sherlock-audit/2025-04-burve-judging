# Misscalculation of `assetsToWithdraw` in `E4626::commit(...)` leads to invalid vault accounting

### Summary

The `Burve` protocol utilizes a specific strategy to keep track of their vault states, by stacking up `deposits` and `withdrawals` in different actions, and `committing` at the end of each flow. By doing so, the protocol can save on vault deposits and withdrawals by checking if the deposit amount is larger than the withdrawal amount and only depositing the excess, and vice versa. However, there seems to be an issue when the amount to withdraw is more than the deposit amount, as the `assetsToWithdraw` is incorrectly reduced, leading to invalid vault accounting.

### Root Cause

In `E4626::commit(...)`, the `assetsToWithdraw` variable is being [incorrectly calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-04-burve/blob/main/Burve/src/multi/vertex/E4626.sol#L71-L74) in the case when `assetsToWithdraw > assetsToDeposit`. `assetsToDeposit` is set to `0` before being deducted from `assetsToWithdraw`, which will cause the vault to withdraw more funds than required, leading to improper accounting.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Stack up different actions that queue deposits and withdrawals in the vault proxy.

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Burve vaults will have fewer funds deposited and more funds withdrawn, as all `assetsToDeposit` will be set to `0` before being deducted from the overall withdrawals.

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Deduct `assetsToDeposit` from `assetsToWithdraw` before setting it to `0`.
